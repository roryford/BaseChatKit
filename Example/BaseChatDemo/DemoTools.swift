        BaseChatKit has five public targets:
        - BaseChatInference — protocols and orchestration.
        - BaseChatCore — SwiftData persistence.
        - BaseChatBackends — MLX, llama.cpp, Foundation, and cloud backends.
        - BaseChatUI — SwiftUI views and view models.
        - BaseChatTools — reference tools and the fuzzing harness.

        # Tool Calling

        Register a ToolExecutor on the ToolRegistry you pass to InferenceService.
        The GenerationCoordinator dispatches ToolCall events through the registry
        and threads the ToolResult back into the conversation.
