///
/// 1. The machine never panics or diverges — rejected transitions leave
///    the phase unchanged.

/// 3. Any transition the machine accepts must also satisfy
///    ``ActivityPhaseStateMachine/isLegalTransition(from:to:)``, so the
///    static predicate and the mutating apply stay in lock-step.
