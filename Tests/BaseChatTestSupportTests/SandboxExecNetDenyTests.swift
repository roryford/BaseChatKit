/// Phase 5 of #714: validates the **`sandbox-exec` net-deny isolation layer**.
///
/// `DenyAllURLProtocol` (Phase 1, PR #715) intercepts `URLSession`-mediated
/// traffic but cannot see `Network.framework` (`NWConnection`, `NWBrowser`),
/// raw BSD sockets, `getaddrinfo(3)`, mDNS/Bonjour, `CFStream`, or
/// `Process.launch` of `/usr/bin/curl`. `TrafficBoundaryAuditTest` rule 2
/// catches these at the **source** level, but a transitive dependency or a
/// particularly creative regression could still bypass the source audit.
///
/// macOS `sandbox-exec` provides a second runtime layer at the **OS sandbox
/// boundary**: any outbound network operation — regardless of API — triggers
/// a sandbox violation. This file pins the harness invariants that
/// `scripts/test-sandboxed.sh` relies on:
///
/// 1. `sandbox-exec` is available on the test host.
/// 2. The deny-network profile **blocks** an outbound `curl` request.
/// 3. The deny-network profile **does not block** local-only operations
///    (so legitimate test work still runs).
/// 4. The deny-network profile blocks `Network.framework` (`NWConnection`)
///    — the gap `DenyAllURLProtocol` cannot cover.
///
/// ## Why this lives in `BaseChatTestSupportTests`
///
/// `BaseChatTestSupportTests` runs in the default CI suite and houses the
/// `DenyAllURLProtocol` tests. Putting the sandbox-exec harness check next to
/// its source-level twin keeps the two isolation layers — runtime
/// `URLProtocol` interception and OS-level sandbox — discoverable together.
///
/// ## Sabotage check
///
/// Per `CLAUDE.md` the test suite is sabotage-verified before commit: with
/// the `(deny network*)` line removed from the profile, the curl assertion
/// flips to a successful exit code. The line is restored before push.
