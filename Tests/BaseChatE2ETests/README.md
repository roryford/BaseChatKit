# BaseChatE2ETests

Hardware-gated end-to-end tests. **These do not run in CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`
runs only the mock-friendly suites). They exist for developer pre-push verification
and skip cleanly when the required hardware/fixtures are missing.

Each test guards itself with one of:

- `XCTSkipUnless(HardwareRequirements.isAppleSilicon)` — Metal / llama.cpp tests.
- `XCTSkipUnless(HardwareRequirements.isPhysicalDevice)` — simulator lacks Metal.
- `XCTSkipUnless(HardwareRequirements.hasOllamaServer)` — Ollama-driven tests.
- A direct fixture-path probe (e.g. `LlamaThinkingE2ETests`).

## Running

```bash
# All E2E tests; most will skip when their fixture / server isn't present.
swift test --filter BaseChatE2ETests --disable-default-traits

# Targeted: just the Llama thinking pipeline.
swift test --filter BaseChatE2ETests/LlamaThinkingE2ETests --disable-default-traits

# Llama-trait-gated tests (Apple Silicon required).
swift test --filter BaseChatE2ETests --traits Llama
```

## Test fixtures

### GGUF models (`LlamaE2ETests`, `LlamaBackendLoadSerializationCharacterizationE2ETests`)

Place any quantized GGUF >= 50 MB in `~/Documents/Models/`. The first matching file is
picked up by `HardwareRequirements.findGGUFModel()`. SmolLM2 or Qwen2.5 fixtures are
sufficient for non-thinking tests.

### Thinking GGUF (`LlamaThinkingE2ETests`)

`LlamaThinkingE2ETests` exercises the `LlamaGenerationDriver` thinking-parser
integration, so it needs a model that actually emits `<think>...</think>` blocks.
The Qwen3 family is the canonical fixture (Qwen3-0.6B is the smallest and runs on
machines with as little as 8 GB RAM).

**Canonical path** (preferred):

```
~/Library/Caches/BaseChatKit/test-models/qwen3-thinking.gguf
```

The test also falls back to any GGUF discovered by `findGGUFModel()` in
`~/Documents/Models/` and skips cleanly when the discovered model does not emit
thinking tokens (e.g. when it picks up a non-Qwen3 fixture).

**Recommended download** — Qwen3-0.6B-Instruct-GGUF (Q4_K_M quant is ~440 MB):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Caches/BaseChatKit/test-models
curl -L \
  "https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF/resolve/main/Qwen3-0.6B-Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  -o ~/Library/Caches/BaseChatKit/test-models/qwen3-thinking.gguf
```

> **Note:** verify the exact file name on HuggingFace before downloading — the Qwen
> team occasionally renames quants. Any Qwen3 GGUF that emits `<think>` blocks works;
> the test does not depend on a specific quant or size.

### MLX models (`ModelSelectionE2ETests`, etc.)

Place an MLX snapshot directory (containing `config.json`, `*.safetensors`, and a
tokenizer file) under `~/Documents/Models/`. `HardwareRequirements.findMLXModelDirectory()`
discovers it.

### Ollama (`OllamaE2ETests`, `OllamaThinkingE2ETests`, `OllamaToolCallingE2ETests`)

Run Ollama locally:

```bash
brew install ollama
ollama serve &
ollama pull qwen3.5:4b   # for thinking tests
ollama pull llama3.2:3b  # for general tests
```

The tests skip automatically when `localhost:11434` is unreachable.
