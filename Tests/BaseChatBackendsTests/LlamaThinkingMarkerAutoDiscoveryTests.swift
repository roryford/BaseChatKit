///
///   1. `LlamaModelLoader.readChatTemplateMetadata` reads the GGUF's
///      `tokenizer.chat_template` at load time and runs it through
///      `ThinkingMarkers.fromChatTemplate` — the result is cached on the
///      backend as `_autoDetectedThinkingMarkers`.
///   2. `GenerationConfig.thinkingMarkers` always overrides the cached
///      auto-detected value.
///
/// The pure-Swift mapping from chat template to marker preset is exercised by
/// `PromptTemplateDetectorTests`; this file pins the integration on real GGUFs.
