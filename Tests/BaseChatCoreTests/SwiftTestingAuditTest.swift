import XCTest

/// Guards against regressions on issue #681: `@Suite` and `@Test` annotations
/// added to test targets that share a single `swift test` process invocation
/// with XCTest suites.
///
/// ## Why this matters
///
/// Running Swift Testing (`@Suite`/`@Test`) and XCTest suites in the same
/// `swift test` process triggers a libmalloc double-free SIGABRT. The CI
/// workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) therefore keeps `BaseChatInferenceTests`
/// (XCTest-only) and `BaseChatInferenceSwiftTestingTests` (Swift Testing-only)
/// in separate process invocations. That split is expensive — it adds a full
/// compile-and-link step to every CI run.
///
/// The "Core + UI + Backends" step merges three targets into one invocation:
///
///     scripts/test.sh --filter BaseChatCoreTests \
///                     --filter BaseChatUITests \
///                     --filter BaseChatBackendsTests \
///                     --disable-default-traits
///
/// `BaseChatCoreTests` and `BaseChatUITests` are XCTest-only. The small set of
/// Swift Testing files in `BaseChatBackendsTests` was migrated before the crash
/// was understood and are committed as an approved baseline. No further growth
/// is allowed unless the CI step is explicitly split.
///
/// ## Allowlist format
///
/// ``allowedAnnotationCountPerFile`` maps
/// `"<TargetDir>/<Filename.swift>"` → maximum number of `@Suite` + `@Test`
/// occurrences (excluding comment lines) the file is permitted to contain.
///
/// Raising a limit or adding a new entry requires human review and a matching
/// CI-step split (or proof that the SIGABRT is fixed in the Swift toolchain).
///
/// ## Updating the allowlist
///
/// If you add Swift Testing annotations to an already-allowlisted file and the
/// count exceeds its threshold, bump the threshold here after verifying:
///
/// 1. The new tests don't mix XCTest and Swift Testing in the same file.
/// 2. The CI step for that target is still process-isolated.
/// 3. A reviewer has sign-off on the bump.
///
/// DO NOT add entries or raise limits solely to make this test pass without
/// completing those verification steps.
