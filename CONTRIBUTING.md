# Contributing to BaseChatKit

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This guide is **indexed by change type** — find the section that matches the change
you're making and follow the gates listed there. Cross-references point at
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), the authoritative dev reference, rather than duplicating it.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roryford/BaseChatKit.git
cd BaseChatKit
swift build
swift test
```

`swift build` resolves package dependencies on first run. `BaseChatBackends` pulls in
MLX and llama.cpp xcframeworks under default traits, so the initial fetch may take a
moment.

The trait set defaults to `MLX, Llama` (the offline build mode) — see
[SECURITY.md § Supported Build Modes](SECURITY.md#supported-build-modes) for the
four blessed configurations and what each one guarantees.

For repo-developer build-mode workflow (Xcode trait limitations, common mistakes,
the `#warning` stub mechanism), see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

## Pre-push checklist

**Run before every push.** CI is macOS-only with a 10× billing multiplier; each
failed push wastes ~25 billed minutes.

```bash
swift test --filter BaseChatCoreTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceSwiftTestingTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatUITests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatUIModelManagementTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatMCPTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatBackendsTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatTestSupportTests --disable-default-traits \
  && swift test --filter BaseChatAppIntentsTests --disable-default-traits
```

Never push based on a subset passing. After rebasing, always re-run the full suite —
conflicts can silently break tests that compiled fine before.

When changing the behaviour of any function or type, grep the entire `Tests/`
directory for references — not just the obvious test file:

```bash
grep -r "functionOrTypeName" Tests/
```

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the canonical test conventions, hardware constraints,
and the `withKnownIssue` policy.

## Adding a new backend

A backend is anything that conforms to `InferenceBackend` and gets registered with
`InferenceService`.

1. **Pick the right trait** for the file. The four trait gates are:
   - `MLX` — Apple Silicon MLX backend.
   - `Llama` — llama.cpp / GGUF.
   - `Ollama` — self-hosted HTTP (in defaults today; opt-in next major).
   - `CloudSaaS` — third-party SaaS (Claude, OpenAI). Off by default.

   Wrap the backend file's contents in `#if <Trait>` so it does not compile in
   modes that exclude it.

2. **Register via `DefaultBackends.register(with:)`** rather than calling backend
   constructors from app code. The registration helper handles trait gating and
   default-backend wiring; direct constructor calls bypass that and emit
   deprecation warnings.

3. **Update `APIProvider.availableInBuild`** so the UI provider picker doesn't
   list a backend whose code isn't linked. Match the existing `#if` gating.

4. **Add tests in `BaseChatBackendsTests`** with the matching `#if <Trait>` so
   they don't run in trait sets that exclude the backend.

5. **HTTP I/O goes through `URLSessionProvider`.** Direct `URLSession.shared` use
   is banned by `TrafficBoundaryAuditTest` Rule 1. If your backend speaks HTTP,
   it must use `URLSessionProvider` so the runtime kill-switch
   (`URLSessionProvider.networkDisabled`) covers it.

6. **Hostname literals** (`https://api.example.com`) are allowlisted per file by
   the audit's Rule 3 (`allowedHostnameFiles`). If your backend introduces a new
   hostname, add the *file* to the allowlist with a justification comment — not
   the hostname itself, and never inline-suppress the rule.

7. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --filter BaseChatBackendsTests --disable-default-traits
   swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceTests --disable-default-traits   # for the audit
   ```
   On Apple Silicon, also run `--traits MLX,Llama` so the actual hardware-bound
   tests execute.

See [SECURITY.md § Supported Build Modes](SECURITY.md#supported-build-modes) and
[docs/THREAT_MODEL.md § B1 Network ↔ device](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#b1-network--device)
for the security context.

## Adding a UI view

UI lives in `BaseChatUI` and (for model-management surfaces) `BaseChatUIModelManagement`.

1. **Don't `import BaseChatBackends` from UI.** This is enforced by
   `TrafficBoundaryAuditTest` Rule 6 (import-graph layering) — the back-edge
   would close a dependency cycle. UI consumes inference via
   `BaseChatInference`'s service protocols.

2. **Cloud-config UI** (anything that talks to `APIEndpoint`, lists API providers,
   or reads/writes Keychain entries) goes behind `#if Ollama || CloudSaaS`. In
   the offline build mode, the cloud-config UI compiles out entirely.

3. **Pasteboard writes** must use `localOnly: true` or be added to the
   `privacyAPIAllowlist` with an explicit justification entry. Default
   `UIPasteboard.general` writes broadcast via Continuity — see
   `TrafficBoundaryAuditTest` Rule 4.

4. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --filter BaseChatUITests --disable-default-traits
   swift test --filter BaseChatUIModelManagementTests --disable-default-traits
   ```

For the UI / framework / host-app trust boundary, see
[docs/THREAT_MODEL.md § B5](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#b5-ui--framework--host-application).

## Adding a dependency

A new SwiftPM dependency, a new binary xcframework, or a version bump to an existing
dependency.

1. **Pick a trait gate.** If the dependency only matters for one backend or
   feature, gate the `.product(...)` entry with `condition: .when(traits: [...])`.
   Always-on dependencies need a justification in the PR body.

2. **`Package.resolved`** updates are procurement-relevant. The PR description
   should call out any change to `Package.resolved` so downstream consumers can
   match it against their own pin policies.

3. **Binary dependencies** (xcframeworks): note that there is no SHA-256 checksum
   pin today, only revision pinning. Tracked under
   [#714](https://github.com/roryford/BaseChatKit/issues/714) Phase 5 — flag the
   PR for security review.

4. **SwiftPM plugins** (`.buildToolPlugin`, `.commandPlugin`) are **banned** by
   `TrafficBoundaryAuditTest` Rule 5. Plugins run at build time with full
   filesystem + network access; adding one requires explicit security review and
   an audit allowlist update.

5. **`unsafeFlags` and `linkedFramework("Network")` / `linkedFramework("CFNetwork")`**
   are banned by the same audit rule. Don't try to work around it.

6. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceTests --disable-default-traits
   ```

See [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md § B3 Build time ↔ run time](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#b3-build-time--run-time).

## Adding a network feature

A new HTTP client, a new endpoint, a new request shape — anything that crosses the
network boundary.

1. **`URLSession` use is allowlisted per-file** by the audit's Rule 1
   (`networkIOAllowlist`). New network code goes in an existing allowlisted file
   when possible. Adding a *file* to the allowlist requires reviewer sign-off —
   the cap is intentionally low.

2. **Hostname literals** (`https?://[host]…`) are allowlisted by Rule 3. UI and
   Inference source must not contain hostname literals; cloud backend files do.

3. **All HTTP traffic must route through `URLSessionProvider`** so the runtime
   kill-switch (`URLSessionProvider.networkDisabled`) covers it.

4. **SSE responses** must consume through `SSEStreamParser` with the default
   `SSEStreamLimits` (or a justified narrower override). Don't bypass the bounds.

5. **Cloud error bodies** must run through `CloudErrorSanitizer.sanitize(_:host:)`
   before surfacing to the UI or `Log.*`.

6. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --filter BaseChatBackendsTests --disable-default-traits
   swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceTests --disable-default-traits
   swift test --filter BaseChatTestSupportTests --disable-default-traits
   ```

See [SECURITY.md § Supported Build Modes](SECURITY.md#supported-build-modes) for
trait-mode behaviour and
[docs/THREAT_MODEL.md § Network exfiltration](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#network-exfiltration).

## Adding a macro

Macros live in `Sources/BaseChatMacrosPlugin/`. They run at build time with full
shell privileges, so the rules are tighter:

1. **Banned in macro source:** `Foundation.URLSession`, `Process()`, `posix_spawn`.
   Audit Rule 2 catches these.

2. **Macro output** must be covered by a snapshot test so a future change to the
   macro doesn't silently rewrite generated source.

3. The macro plugin sandbox is on the Phase 5 roadmap
   ([#714](https://github.com/roryford/BaseChatKit/issues/714)). Until then, every
   macro change gets a manual security review.

4. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --disable-default-traits   # exercises macro tests under all suites
   ```

See [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md § Build-time exfiltration via macros](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md#build-time-exfiltration-via-macros).

## Adding a setting / configuration flag

A new `BaseChatConfiguration` field, a new `@Environment` injection point, or a new
trait.

1. **Runtime configuration → `BaseChatConfiguration`.** Document the default in
   the field's doc comment.

2. **Build-time configuration → a new trait.** Add it to the `traits:` list in
   `Package.swift` with a one-line description. The audit's Rule 7 will
   immediately reject any `#if` typo against the new trait.

3. **If the flag affects a documented guarantee** (e.g. fail-closed behaviour,
   pinning policy, file-protection class), update
   [SECURITY.md § Supported Build Modes](SECURITY.md#supported-build-modes) and
   [docs/THREAT_MODEL.md](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md) in the same PR.

4. **README impact:** if the flag changes how a consumer chooses a build mode,
   update the README's build-mode decision table too.

5. **Run before pushing:**
   ```bash
   swift test --filter BaseChatCoreTests --disable-default-traits
   swift test --filter BaseChatInferenceTests --disable-default-traits
   ```

PR titles must follow the same format — CI enforces this via `commitlint`.

Add a body when the *why* needs explanation. Don't restate what the diff already
shows.

```
fix: prevent context overflow when system prompt exceeds budget

The trimMessages fallback returned an empty array when the system prompt
alone exceeded maxTokens. Always return at least the last user message so
generation has something to work with.
```

## Pull request process

1. **Branch off `main`.** Direct pushes to `main` are blocked.
2. **Open a PR via `gh`:** `gh pr create --title "feat: ..." --body "..."`.
3. **Don't pass `--auto` or `--merge`.** Merges require human approval.
4. **Report the PR URL** so the maintainer can review.
5. **Wait for CI** before flagging "ready to merge". CI runs every CI-safe test
   suite listed in the [Pre-push checklist](#pre-push-checklist).

The maintainer merges PRs once at least one approval is received and CI is green.

## PR hygiene

CI is macOS-only and runs ~5 minutes per push. Each unnecessary PR or issue costs
real money and reviewer attention.

- **One feature = one PR**, even when it touches multiple backends. A change like
  "tool calling" or "thinking budget" should land as one PR with a backend
  checklist in the body, not five PRs.
- **Tests and docs ship in the feature PR.** Don't open standalone `test:` or
  `docs:` PRs for in-flight work — they cost CI minutes and invent merge
  conflicts. Standalone `test:` / `docs:` PRs are appropriate only for already-
  shipped features.
- **Single-file PRs are a smell.** Check whether there's a sibling PR you could
  batch into.
- **Don't open follow-up issues for "while I'm here" cleanups.** Fold them into
  the current PR or leave a `// TODO:` in the code. The issue tracker is for
  things that need cross-session memory **and** external visibility.

For the full PR-hygiene rationale, see [CLAUDE.md § Issue & PR hygiene](CLAUDE.md).
