## What does this change?

<!-- One paragraph summary -->

## Motivation

<!-- Why is this change needed? Link to any relevant issues with "Closes #123" -->

## Release Note

<!-- For feat: and fix: PRs, draft the release-note fragment here in the
     Prisma-style format used by BaseChatKit since v0.11.2. This gets copied
     into CHANGELOG.md at release time, so write it like a reader sees it.

     For a HEADLINE feature (new subsystem, cross-cutting change, API
     consumers need to know about), use this shape:

         #### Short verb-led headline

         2–3 sentences: the problem, what shipped, how it fits together.

         ```swift
         // 4–8 lines showing the new API in use
         ```

         One more sentence of caveats, opt-in/out semantics, or "see [#N]".

     For a SMALL feature or fix, one bullet is enough — match the style
     of the Features/Fixes sections in CHANGELOG.md:

         - **scope:** what changed — why it matters ([#N])

     For chore/test/docs PRs, write "N/A". -->

## Testing

<!-- How was this tested? Which test targets cover it? -->
<!-- Note: BaseChatCoreTests and BaseChatUITests run in CI. Hardware-dependent tests (BaseChatBackendsTests, BaseChatE2ETests) run locally. -->

## Sabotage evidence (regression-test PRs only)

<!-- For any PR adding a regression test: temporarily revert the fix / break the
     code path under test, confirm the new test goes RED, then re-apply the fix
     and confirm GREEN. Paste the diff and red-run log (or link to a comment
     that contains them). Exempt: pure refactors, docs-only PRs, dep bumps. -->

- [ ] N/A (not a regression-test PR)
