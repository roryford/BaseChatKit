# ManifoldKit — guide for AI coding assistants

This is ManifoldKit's detailed, tool-neutral reference. The canonical session
entry point is `AGENTS.md`, which requires the relevant sections here before
acting. This file has three parts:

- **Part 0 — Principles**: the project invariants. Short, and they should
  rarely change.
- **Part 1 — Using ManifoldKit** (consumers): the recipe-shaped surface for an
  assistant helping a human use ManifoldKit in their app — imports, bootstrap,
  the public API.
- **Part 2 — Contributing to ManifoldKit** (internal conventions): targets,
  dependency rules, testing, and the release/PR workflow for an assistant
  changing ManifoldKit itself.

`CLAUDE.md` imports the canonical root and adds only Claude-specific notes.
For session bootstrap and global safety rules, the canonical root wins; the
copy below is retained only to preserve the former guide's context.

## Session bootstrap (any harness)

1. Read `~/Repos/roryford/estate/policies/DIGEST.md` — the standing policies,
   compiled to one page.
2. Read this repo's known-issues buffer — solved non-obvious failures.
   **Check it before diagnosing**, and append to it when you solve one.
   Which file (canonical source: `~/Repos/roryford/estate/estate.yaml`
   `conventions.memory_files.known_issues` / `known_issues_legacy`):
   - `.agents/known-issues.md` if present; otherwise `.claude/known-issues.md`
     (the older path, still in use in most repos). "Present" means it has
     content — a file that is empty, or only newlines and spaces, does not
     count. (Claude's hook prefers the committed copy on the default branch
     when *choosing* which file to read, then injects the **union** of that
     copy and yours — so an entry you wrote locally and have not pushed is
     normally still shown. Not always: if the union cannot be computed — a
     buffer with no entry markers, an unbalanced code fence, awk missing — the
     hook says so and withholds your local-only entries. A `NOTE` mentioning
     either is the hook refusing to guess, not a bug. Read the file yourself
     and you are never subject to any of this.)
   - **Append to the one that exists; never create the other.** Two files means
     half the entries stop being injected.
   - If **both** exist the buffer is already forked — **report it, don't repair
     it here.** Which half is dark depends on the machine's hook, so the repair
     has a per-machine precondition: see
     `~/Repos/roryford/estate/policies/knowledge-capture.md`, "Both files
     present".
   - If **neither** exists, create `.agents/known-issues.md` — the neutral
     path. (You are reading this section, so you will find it next time
     regardless of what any harness hook does.)
3. Then follow this file's Running tests / Coding conventions / Pre-push checklist.

**If you are not Claude Code, none of the above happens for you automatically —
just do steps 1-3.** Claude Code *may* have injected 1 and 2 already via its
own SessionStart hook, but that hook is installed per machine and does not run
for Grok, Codex, Cursor or OpenCode whatever is on the box. Reading the files
yourself is always correct and never wrong, which is why the steps say "read".

Pointers only — this section never restates DIGEST content.

# Part 0 — Principles

These are the things that must stay true as everything else changes. Parts 1
and 2 churn with every refactor; this list should not. Each principle names
its enforcement, because a rule nobody checks is a suggestion — and for the
same reason, **a new rule ships with its enforcement in the same PR, or it is
not a rule.**

1. **Built for sustained development, not the demo.** ManifoldKit is for
   building and operating real apps over months and years. Getting started is
   simple (one import, one bootstrap recipe, one way to send a message), and
   staying productive is too: docs stay truthful as the API evolves, recipes
   keep compiling, upgrade paths are written down. AI assistants are
   first-class readers — their common mistakes against this API are documented
   and corrected. *(Cold-start gates, doc-snippet compile gate,
   `AgentsMdAuditTest`, `DocClaimsAuditTest`, `DocsAudienceStatusAuditTest`.)*
2. **Dependencies flow one way.** UI → Runtime → Inference → Contract →
   leaves. Backends plug into the Contract kernel; the kernel never depends on
   the engine; UI never imports a backend. A cycle is a regression no matter
   how convenient. *(`TrafficBoundaryAuditTest`,
   `ManifoldContractNoEngineDependencyTests`, the package manifest itself.)*
3. **Heavy dependencies are opt-in.** Plain `swift build` is the full core
   build. A dependency whose build cost rivals the core (macro toolchains,
   server frameworks, GPU runtimes) goes behind a trait or into a companion
   package. A consumer who wants only chat pays only for chat. *(No default
   traits — a structural fact of the manifest.)*
4. **Every rule has a tripwire, and the tripwires are tested.** Forbidden
   patterns get audit tests that scan the source; every audit carries an
   in-file `test_sabotage_*` that plants a known violation and runs the
   audit's own detection function against it, per-PR.
   *(In-file sabotage tests + `AuditSabotageCoverageAuditTest`.)*
5. **Tests are honest.** Classified truthfully (SwiftData ⇒ integration
   test), real `async`/`await`, never a mocked persistence layer, shipped in
   the same PR as the change. A test that cannot be shown to fail is not
   coverage. *(`TestSuiteSilentSkipAuditTest`; conventions in
   `Tests/README.md`.)*
6. **Errors are visible.** No `try?` in production code; `do`/`catch` and
   log. `fatalError`/`assertionFailure` only for programmer errors with no
   recovery path — and the same standard holds for shell tooling: no
   fail-open swallows in `scripts/`. *(`SilentCatchAuditTest`, force-unwrap
   lint, `ScriptFailOpenAuditTest`.)*
7. **Swift concurrency, done properly.** `@Observable` + `@MainActor`, no
   Combine, no `Task.detached` in `@MainActor` classes, and never
   `@unchecked Sendable` as a race fix — fix the isolation boundary.
   *(Strict Swift 6 builds; the gotcha list in Part 2.)*
8. **One turn loop.** Send/regenerate/edit/cancel/branch have one
   implementation: `ConversationRuntime` and its `TurnDriver`s. New entry
   points (server, MCP host, apps) forward into it; they never reimplement
   it. *(Turn-loop characterization tests pin the observable behavior.)*
9. **Breaking changes are deliberate.** Pre-1.0 allows breakage, never casual
   breakage: migration docs for every retired API, a changelog written for
   humans, known consumers (companions, example apps) built against the
   change before release. Only removals are irreversible — bias toward
   migration and lockstep, not toward never removing. *(API-break diff in CI,
   changelog lint, release-time demo/companion builds.)*
10. **Shipped means live.** Done = exercised end to end, not compiled. A read
    path with no writer or a flag nothing reads lies to every future reader.
    Every review asks: is this actually live? *(Review loop; fuzzer and
    integration sweeps drive real traffic.)*
11. **No secret ever touches the repository.** Not in a file, not behind
    `.gitignore`, not in history — a leak is the one mistake a revert cannot
    undo. Templates hold references, never values. *(Per-PR secret scanning;
    keychain-only credential storage in the product.)*

# Part 1 — Using ManifoldKit (consumers)

ManifoldKit is a Swift package. Install via SwiftPM:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ManifoldKit/ManifoldKit.git", from: "0.77.0") // x-release-please-version
```

> **Pre-1.0.** Minor versions can introduce breaking changes. For production,
> pin to a specific tag (`exact: "0.64.0"`) and read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
> before bumping. The `0.x` line stabilises pieces incrementally; `1.0.0` will
> be the freeze point.

## Imports

App code should `import ManifoldKit` — the umbrella product re-exports the
five most-imported modules in one line:

```swift
import ManifoldKit   // covers Inference, Runtime, PersistenceSwiftData, the backend families, UI
```

Specialised modules stay opt-in and are imported by name when you need them:

| Product | Import when you need… |
|---------|------------------------|
| **`ManifoldKit`** *(umbrella, the default)* | `ChatView`, `ChatViewModel`, `ManifoldBootstrap`, `quickStart(backends:)`, `InferenceService`, `BackendName` — the 80%-case surface. |
| `ManifoldUIModelManagement` | `ModelManagementSheet`, `APIConfigurationView`, model browser/download UI. Not in the umbrella because chat-only consumers can ship without 1,800+ LOC of management surface. |
| `ManifoldHuggingFace` *(optional)* | Hub search, browse, background downloads. Compiles unconditionally (the `HuggingFace` trait retired in v0.48). |
| `ManifoldVoice` *(optional)* | Speech I/O composer accessory. |
| `ManifoldMCP` *(optional, experimental¹)* | Model Context Protocol client + tool bridge. Compiles unconditionally (no trait since v0.48). |
| `ManifoldAppIntents` *(optional, experimental¹)* | AppIntent ↔ ToolDefinition bridge. |
| `ManifoldAgentInstructions` *(optional, experimental¹)* | `AGENTS.md` ambient-instruction discovery — `AgentInstructionContextProvider` (a `PromptContextProvider`). Wire it via `ConversationRuntimeOptions.addAgentInstructions(currentDirectory:stoppingAt:)`. |
| `ManifoldMLX` / `ManifoldLlama` *(companion packages)* | MLX / llama.cpp local inference — add `manifold-mlx` / `manifold-llama` as separate package dependencies and pass `MLXBackends.self` / `LlamaBackends.self` to `quickStart(backends:)` (v0.48 split). |

¹ Experimental — may break in any minor, always migration-noted; graduates on first
real adopter (a shipping app or companion that pins and imports it). See
docs/API-DESIGN.md § 7b. For the complete maturity picture across every
published product (not just the Experimental ones), see
[docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md](docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md).

Contributors changing ManifoldKit internals can still import the individual products
(`ManifoldInference`, `ManifoldRuntime`, `ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData`, the backend
families `ManifoldFoundation`/`ManifoldOllama`/`ManifoldCloudSaaS`, `ManifoldUI`);
the umbrella is the consumer-facing surface.

The dependency graph is one-way: UI depends on Runtime depends on Inference;
backends depend on Inference directly. Never import a backend family
(`ManifoldFoundation`/`ManifoldOllama`/`ManifoldCloudSaaS`) from a view target —
CI lint rejects that edge.

## Bootstrap recipe (canonical hello-world)

The shipped `ManifoldBootstrap.build(...)` wires inference, persistence, the
conversation runtime, and the model container in the right order. Because it
is `async`, wire it from a `.task { }` on the launch view — **not** from
`App.init()`, which is synchronous and would deadlock:

```swift,no-build:defines the app entry point; `ContentView` is defined in the next block, so this one cannot compile in isolation
import SwiftUI
import SwiftData
import ManifoldKit
import ManifoldUIModelManagement   // model browser/download UI is opt-in

@main
struct MyChatApp: App {
    @State private var bootstrap: ManifoldBootstrap?
    @State private var chatViewModel: ChatViewModel?
    @State private var sessionManager: SessionManagerViewModel?
    @State private var modelManagement = ModelManagementViewModel.live()
    @State private var startupError: Error?
    // Named-milestone loading (2026 UI refresh, `BootstrapLoadingScreen.md`) —
    // replaces a bare `ProgressView("Starting…")` with text that tells the
    // user what's actually happening on a slow first launch.
    @State private var milestone: RuntimeBootstrapMilestone = .installingConfiguration

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if let bootstrap, let chatViewModel, let sessionManager {
                ContentView()
                    .environment(chatViewModel)
                    .environment(sessionManager)
                    .environment(modelManagement)
                    // ChatView re-injects this custom environment value into
                    // its API-configuration sheet/popover content.
                    .environment(\.endpointStore, bootstrap.endpointStore)
                    .modelContainer(bootstrap.modelContainer)
            } else if let startupError {
                ContentUnavailableView(
                    "Failed to start",
                    systemImage: "exclamationmark.triangle",
                    description: Text(String(describing: startupError))
                )
            } else {
                BootstrapLoadingView(milestone: milestone)
                    .task { await start() }
            }
        }
    }

    @MainActor
    private func start() async {
        do {
            let (progress, task) = ManifoldBootstrap.build(
                configuration: ManifoldConfiguration(
                    appName: "My Chat",
                    bundleIdentifier: "com.example.mychat"
                )
            )
            for await m in progress { milestone = m }
            let bootstrap = try await task.value

            // Register the compiled-in default families. The `ManifoldBackends`
            // umbrella and `DefaultBackends` were retired in P7 (pre-1.0; see
            // docs/MIGRATION-shims-retired.md); `quickStart()` folds these for
            // you, the manual path registers them explicitly.
            OllamaBackends.register(with: bootstrap.inferenceService)
            CloudSaaSBackends.register(with: bootstrap.inferenceService)
            FoundationBackends.register(with: bootstrap.inferenceService)

            let vm = ChatViewModel(
                inferenceService: bootstrap.inferenceService,
                conversationRuntime: bootstrap.conversationRuntime
            )
            vm.configure(bootstrap: bootstrap)

            // Use configureAndLoad — not configure — so sessions are populated
            // before selectInitialSession() runs (#1464).
            let sessions = SessionManagerViewModel()
            await sessions.configureAndLoad(bootstrap: bootstrap)

            if let restored = await sessions.selectInitialSession() {
                sessions.activeSession = restored
                await vm.switchToSession(restored)
            } else if let fresh = try? await sessions.createSession() {
                sessions.activeSession = fresh
                await vm.switchToSession(fresh)
            }

            // Sessions restore above; a *model* does not. Manual bootstrap does
            // not auto-select Foundation or the first stored cloud endpoint
            // (unlike quickStart() on relaunch). Seed + load before showing UI:
            //   Foundation → docs/QUICKSTART.md "Seeding Foundation Models"
            //   Ollama/cloud → setAvailableEndpoints + selectedEndpoint +
            //     await loadSelectedEndpoint() every cold start
            //   (full Ollama recipe: docs/SWIFTUI-MULTI-SESSION.md §6)

            self.bootstrap = bootstrap
            self.chatViewModel = vm
            self.sessionManager = sessions
        } catch {
            self.startupError = error
        }
    }
}
```

The corresponding `ContentView` is small:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ManifoldKit
import ManifoldUIModelManagement

struct ContentView: View {
    @Environment(ChatViewModel.self) private var vm
    @Environment(ModelManagementViewModel.self) private var mm
    @Environment(SessionManagerViewModel.self) private var sessionVM
    @State private var showModelManagement = false

    var body: some View {
        NavigationSplitView {
            SessionListView()
        } detail: {
            ChatView(
                showModelManagement: $showModelManagement,
                apiConfiguration: { APIConfigurationView() }
            )
            .sheet(isPresented: $showModelManagement) {
                ModelManagementSheet(modelRegistry: vm.modelRegistry)
                    .environment(mm)
            }
        }
        .onChange(of: sessionVM.activeSession) { _, newSession in
            guard let newSession,
                  vm.activeSession?.id != newSession.id else { return }
            Task { await vm.switchToSession(newSession) }
        }
    }
}
```

`Example/Examples/MinimalExample/` is the runnable version of this — keep it
open while you wire the real app.

> For a single-session surface without a sidebar, `ManifoldKit.quickStart()`
> collapses the `start()` method above into one call. See
> [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for that path.
>
> For the complete end-to-end recipe (local SwiftPM path, Ollama seeding,
> `ManifoldUIModelManagement` optionality), see
> [`docs/SWIFTUI-MULTI-SESSION.md` § Full recipe](docs/SWIFTUI-MULTI-SESSION.md).

## Sending a message

The user-facing API is **`vm.sendMessage(_:)`** (NOT `vm.send(_:)` — that name
does not exist on `ChatViewModel`):

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
let reply = try await vm.sendMessage("hi")
print(reply.content)
```

For scripted drivers / integration tests, `sendMessage(_:)` returns the
completed `ChatMessage`. Polling `vm.lastTurnState` after the awaited call
inspects the same outcome:

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
await vm.sendMessage()                  // uses vm.inputText + draftAttachments
switch vm.lastTurnState {
case .completed(let record): /* use record */
case .failed(let err):       /* surface error */
case .idle, .generating:     /* unexpected */
}
```

`sendMessage(_:)` throws `SendMessageError` when a turn ends without producing a
message. Make sure a session is selected and a model is loaded first; the
method enforces both preconditions.

## Backend identity

`BackendName` is an extensible `RawRepresentable` struct — the
`Notification.Name` / `URLResourceKey` pattern — **not an enum**. It was
converted from `enum: String` to a struct in #1742 so third-party backends
(including those added after ManifoldKit 1.0 ships) can mint new identifiers
via `BackendName(rawValue:)` without breaking every downstream exhaustive
`switch`. Six well-known identifiers ship as `public static let` constants.
Compare via the typed accessor — never against raw string literals:

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
import ManifoldKit   // re-exports ManifoldInference

if vm.activeBackendName == BackendName.foundation.rawValue {
    // Foundation-specific copy
}
```

Because the type is open, a `switch` over `BackendName` needs a `default:`
arm now — `case .foundation:` style pattern matching still works (Swift's
default `~=` for `Equatable` types), but the compiler can no longer prove the
well-known constants are exhaustive. `BackendName.wellKnown` lists them (also
available as `.allCases` for source compatibility with the pre-#1742 enum):

| Identifier | Raw value (0.19+) | Legacy (0.18.x) |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `.foundation` | `"foundation"` | `"Apple"` |
| `.ollama` | `"ollama"` | `"Ollama"` |
| `.claude` | `"claude"` | `"Claude"` |
| `.openAI` | `"openAI"` | `"OpenAI"` |
| `.mlx` | `"mlx"` | `"MLX"` |
| `.llama` | `"llama"` | `"llama.cpp"` |

`BackendName.parse(_:)` accepts both the canonical 0.19+ form and the legacy
0.18 strings, so apps reading already-persisted backend names off disk migrate
in place:

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
if let backend = BackendName.parse(persisted) {
    // 0.18 "Apple" and 0.19 "foundation" both map to .foundation here.
}
```

## Message types

There are three message-shaped types. Pick the right one:

| Type | Module | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `ChatMessage` (struct) | `ManifoldInference` | Transport / app code. The shape `sendMessage(_:)` returns. |
| `PersistedChatMessage` (`@Model`) | `ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData` | SwiftData row — owned by the persistence layer. The only public name; the bare `ChatMessage` shadow alias was removed pre-1.0 (issue #2153 item 2.8). |
| `StructuredMessage` | `ManifoldInference` | Cloud-wire payload assembled by `InferenceService`. Internal — backends consume it. |

App code reads and writes `ChatMessage` (the struct). The persistence and wire types
are managed by ManifoldKit.

## Theming the chat UI

The 2026 UI refresh (issue #2307) ships a new default look — a deliberate
pre-1.0 visual break (Principle 9), not a silent drift. The token root is
`ManifoldTheme` (`Sources/ManifoldUI/Theming/ManifoldTheme.swift`), injected
via `.manifoldTheme(_:)`; it embeds the original `ChatTheme` (bubble tokens)
and adds surfaces/inks/status/info/categorical tiers plus a corner-radius
scale (`ManifoldThemeShapeScale`) and text-style roles
(`ManifoldThemeTypeScale`). Five style-protocol seams — `MessageBubbleStyle`,
`ComposerStyle`, `ThinkingBlockStyle`, `ToolInvocationStyle`,
`SessionRowStyle` — each follow one recipe: protocol + `Configuration` data
struct + `@Entry` environment key + cascading modifier + static accessors
(`.plain`, `.glass`, `.card`, …). A `chatMessagePartRenderer(_:)` seam gives a
host first refusal on one content part (a specific tool call, a
generated-media kind) with `params.defaultPartView()` falling through to the
built-in per-kind view — the finer-grained sibling of `.chatMessageRenderer(_:)`.

**The built-in styles are the new look; `.classic` restores the pre-refresh
appearance in one call:**

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
ChatView(showModelManagement: $show)
    .classicManifoldTheme()
```

See [`docs/MIGRATION-ui-refresh.md`](docs/MIGRATION-ui-refresh.md) for the
full default-appearance change inventory (bubble gradient, corner radius,
composer capsule, reasoning shimmer, tool card, session-row pin glyph) and
[`Sources/ManifoldUI/ManifoldUI.docc/Articles/Theming.md`](Sources/ManifoldUI/ManifoldUI.docc/Articles/Theming.md)
/ `WhiteLabelTheming.md` for the full token-layer walkthrough and a worked
brand-swap recipe.

`ChatView` also exposes an opt-in `.chatModelSwitcher(_:)` seam — a toolbar
chip that presents host-supplied quick-switcher content (popover on macOS,
sheet + `.presentationDetents` on iOS). `ManifoldUI` cannot import the actual
`ModelSwitcherView` (`ManifoldUIModelManagement` depends on `ManifoldUI`,
never the reverse), so the seam is closure-injected exactly like
`chatAPIConfiguration(_:)`; omitting the modifier renders no chip at all.

## Tool calling

Register an executor with `ToolRegistry`, then thread the registry's
`definitions` into `GenerationConfig.tools`:

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
let registry = ToolRegistry()
registry.register(MyWeatherTool())

var config = GenerationConfig()
config.tools = registry.definitions
let (_, stream) = try inferenceService.enqueue(
    messages: history,
    config: config
)
```

### `@ToolSchema` macro requires `--traits Macros`

The `@ToolSchema` macro synthesises `static var jsonSchema` on a `Decodable`
struct. **It is gated behind the `Macros` SwiftPM trait, default-off**, because
the macro plugin pulls swift-syntax (~647 source files) into the build. Opt in
on every consumer:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/ManifoldKit/ManifoldKit.git",
    from: "0.77.0", // x-release-please-version
    traits: [.trait(name: "Macros")]
)
```

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
@ToolSchema
struct WeatherArguments: Decodable, Sendable {
    /// City name
    let city: String
}

let tool = ToolDefinition(
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Returns weather for a city.",
    parameters: WeatherArguments.jsonSchema
)
```

### Manual `JSONSchemaValue` (no Macros trait)

Without `--traits Macros`, declare the parameter schema by hand. `JSONSchemaValue`
is a recursive enum (`.string`, `.number`, `.bool`, `.null`, `.array`, `.object`):

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
let tool = ToolDefinition(
    name: "get_weather",
    description: "Returns weather for a city.",
    parameters: .object([
        "type": .string("object"),
        "properties": .object([
            "city": .object([
                "type": .string("string"),
                "description": .string("City name")
            ])
        ]),
        "required": .array([.string("city")])
    ])
)
```

**Local backend ceiling:** local instruct models (3B–8B) degrade past ~5 tools
per request. Curate per call. Cloud backends handle 20+ tools fine.

## Cloud backend setup

Cloud endpoints (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, LM Studio, custom) flow through
`APIEndpointRecord` values. The 5-step canonical flow:

```swift,no-build:API-shape excerpt for assistants; intentionally terse, no imports or surrounding context
import ManifoldInference

// 1. Build the record.
let endpoint = APIEndpointRecord(
    name: "My OpenAI",
    provider: .openAI,
    baseURL: "https://api.openai.com",
    modelName: "gpt-4o-mini"
)

// 2. Store the API key in the Keychain (throws on failure).
try KeychainService.store(key: "sk-...", account: endpoint.keychainAccount)

// 3. Persist the endpoint via the bootstrap's EndpointStore.
try await bootstrap.endpointStore.insertEndpoint(endpoint)

// 4. Route the chat view model to the new backend.
await vm.loadCloudEndpoint(endpoint)

// 5. Send.
let reply = try await vm.sendMessage("hello")
```

Cloud backends are always compiled in since v0.48 (the `CloudSaaS` /
`Ollama` traits were retired) — no trait flags needed:

```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/ManifoldKit/ManifoldKit.git",
    from: "0.77.0" // x-release-please-version
)
```

`KeychainService.store` / `.delete` and the `APIEndpoint.setAPIKey` /
`.deleteAPIKey` helpers throw `KeychainError` on failure — never use the legacy
`Bool`-returning shape.

## Common LLM hallucinations to avoid

These are mistakes assistants make against ManifoldKit. Don't write any of them:

1. **The umbrella module is `ManifoldKit`** (added in 0.19). Reach for
   `import ManifoldKit` first — it covers Inference, Runtime,
   PersistenceSwiftData, Backends, and UI. Specialised modules
   (`ManifoldUIModelManagement`, `ManifoldMCP`, `ManifoldVoice`, …) stay
   explicit imports.
2. **The send method is `vm.sendMessage(_:)`, NOT `vm.send(_:)`.**
   `ChatViewModel.send` does not exist. Use `try await vm.sendMessage("hi")`
   for scripted use, or set `vm.inputText` and call `await vm.sendMessage()`.
3. **Backend identity comparisons go through `BackendName.<identifier>.rawValue`**
   (e.g. `vm.activeBackendName == BackendName.foundation.rawValue`). The raw
   values flipped from `"Apple"`/`"Ollama"`/`"llama.cpp"` to lowercase
   canonical (`"foundation"`/`"ollama"`/`"llama"`) in 0.19 — code that
   hardcoded the legacy strings breaks. Use `BackendName.parse(_:)` when
   reading already-persisted strings off disk. `BackendName` is an
   extensible struct (since #1742), not an enum — a `switch` over it needs a
   `default:` arm.
4. **Local model loading goes through
   `ChatViewModel.dispatchSelectedLoad()` / `vm.dispatchSelectedLoad()`** —
   there is no shortcut like `vm.loadModel(url:)` or `vm.loadModel(from:)`.
   Foundation Models are the exception: call
   `vm.loadFoundationModelIfAvailable()` directly.
5. **There is no `vm.setTheme(_:)` / `ChatViewModel.theme` property.** Theming
   is a SwiftUI environment cascade, not a view-model API — apply
   `.manifoldTheme(_:)` (or the individual `.messageBubbleStyle(_:)` /
   `.composerStyle(_:)` / `.thinkingBlockStyle(_:)` / `.toolInvocationStyle(_:)`
   / `.sessionRowStyle(_:)` modifiers) to `ChatView` or an ancestor, the same
   shape as SwiftUI's own `.tint(_:)`/`.font(_:)`.
6. **There is no "reasoning effort" enum.** The thinking-budget lever is
   `GenerationConfig.maxThinkingTokens` (Off → `0`, Auto → `nil`, Extended →
   a named budget), gated on `ModelManifest.supportsThinking` — see
   `ThinkingBudgetOption`/`ThinkingBudgetControl` (`ManifoldUIModelManagement`).
   Sampler knobs elsewhere gate on `supportedSamplingParameters` the same way.
7. **There are no per-model theme presets.** `ManifoldTheme`/style-protocol
   choices are a UI-layer concern applied once at (or above) the chat root —
   they do not vary per loaded model, and there is no
   `ModelInfo.recommendedTheme` or similar. The built-in default is the 2026
   refresh's new look; `.classic` (or the individual `.plain` style presets)
   restores the pre-refresh appearance — see
   [`docs/MIGRATION-ui-refresh.md`](docs/MIGRATION-ui-refresh.md).

## Trait gotchas

Since v0.48 there are **no default traits** — plain `swift build` is the full
core build, and the heavy local backends moved to companion packages. What's
left:

- **`Macros` trait (default-off)** — required for `@ToolSchema`. See above.
- **`Server` trait (default-off)** — gates the `manifold-server` executable and
  its Hummingbird dependency tree.
- **MLX / llama.cpp are packages, not traits** — add
  `https://github.com/ManifoldKit/manifold-mlx` / `…/manifold-llama` as separate
  `.package(...)` dependencies and pass their registrars to
  `quickStart(backends:)`. A `traits: ["MLX"]` / `["Llama"]` array now
  hard-errors at resolve time — see docs/MIGRATION-0.48.md.
- **Everything else compiles unconditionally** (cloud, MCP, Voice, Tools,
  AppIntents, AgentInstructions, HuggingFace) — opt in by linking/importing
  the product.

## Concurrency

ManifoldKit is Swift-concurrency-native. The rules:

- **`@Observable` + `@MainActor` everywhere.** The view models are `@Observable`
  (Swift Observation), not Combine `ObservableObject`. Store them in `@State`
  and pass via `.environment(_)`; read with `@Environment(Type.self)`.
- **No Combine, no `@Published`, no callback pyramids.** Async/await throughout.
- **Never use `Task.detached` from a `@MainActor` class.** It captures mutable
  state without inheriting actor isolation. Use `Task { … }` and let the callee
  hop off-actor itself. (Swift 6 doesn't always warn on this — see
  [Part 2 → Swift 6 concurrency gotchas item 5](#swift-6-concurrency-gotchas).)
- **Don't block in `deinit` under `@MainActor` ownership.** Async cleanup hops
  to a `Task.detached` after capturing the resource strongly.
- **Streams are `AsyncThrowingStream<GenerationEvent, Error>`.** Consume with
  `for try await event in stream { … }`. The wrapper alias is `GenerationStream`.

## When in doubt

- Read the relevant source under `Sources/`. The public surface is small.
- The `Example/Examples/MinimalExample/` app is the canonical runnable wiring.
- DocC catalogs live alongside the modules
  (`Sources/ManifoldUI/ManifoldUI.docc/`).
- For a linear, file:line-anchored walk through one message turn — send →
  runtime → engine → backend → stream back to the UI — see
  [`docs/ANATOMY-OF-ONE-TURN.md`](docs/ANATOMY-OF-ONE-TURN.md).
- Contributors changing ManifoldKit internals should use `scripts/test.sh --profile local`
  as the default pre-push gate; **Part 2** below documents the full contributor workflow.
- For contributor-facing conventions (testing, traits, release process), see
  **Part 2 — Contributing to ManifoldKit** below. For consumer-facing API, Part 1 is enough.

## Targets

No target in this repo has heavy ML dependencies — the MLX and llama.cpp families live in companion packages since v0.48 (see "Companion packages" below).

The tables below describe what each target/product *does*. For the
orthogonal question of what stability promise it carries — Core guarantee,
Supported first-party integration, Experimental, or Labs — see
[docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md](docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md), the single
normative source for that signal (issue #2337). The `Experimental¹` markers
below point back to it.

### Core / leaf modules (no SwiftData)

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldNetworking` | Leaf networking primitives: `NetworkActivity` observability funnel, `PrivateIPClassifier`. Pure Foundation, zero upward deps. |
| `ManifoldSecrets` | Leaf security primitives: `KeychainService`, `SecureEnclaveKeyManager`, `SecureBytes`. Pure Security framework, zero upward deps. |
| `ManifoldHardware` | Leaf device-capability + GGUF primitives: device probing, memory-pressure broadcasting, GGUF parsing, load-plan logic. Also the physical home of the tool-calling value types (`ToolDefinition`/`ToolCall`/`ToolResult`/`ToolChoice`/`JSONSchemaValue`) and `BackendCapabilities`, re-exported through `ManifoldContract` via `@_exported import` (`ManifoldContractLeafExports.swift`) — moving them into Contract would cycle, so don't. Zero deps. |
| `ManifoldModelCatalog` | Model discovery/catalog/benchmark + image/video-gen records: `ModelInfo`, `ModelManifest`, `ModelCatalog`, `ModelStorageService`, `DiagnosticsService`, `SettingsService`, `ModelBenchmarkRunner`. Depends on `ManifoldHardware`, `ManifoldNetworking`, `ManifoldSecrets`. |
| `ManifoldContract` | The Contract kernel: backend protocols (`InferenceBackend`, `EmbeddingBackend`), value/stream types (`GenerationConfig`, `GenerationEvent`, `Message`, streaming transforms), plus the tool-calling types re-exported from `ManifoldHardware`. Depends on `ManifoldHardware` + `ManifoldModelCatalog` (`@_exported import`s both). Must NOT depend on `ManifoldInference` — `ManifoldContractNoEngineDependencyTests` is the tripwire. |

### Inference engine + runtime

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldInference` | Inference orchestration engine: `InferenceService`, `GenerationQueue`, `ModelRegistry`, tool subsystem (`ToolExecutor`, `ToolRegistry`, `GenerationToolDispatchLoop`), `PromptAssembler`, `ContextWindowManager`, `TranscriptHealer`, streaming. Depends on `ManifoldContract` (which it `@_exported import`s for source compatibility) + the four P1 leaves. No persistence ports. |
| `ManifoldRuntime` | Persistence ports (`MessageStore`, `SessionStore`, `EndpointStore`, `SamplerPresetStore`, `BenchmarkCache`, `WebSearchRuntime`), use cases (`PromptContextPipeline`, `ChatExportService`, `SessionListService`, `ConversationRuntime`), and session-list orchestration. Depends on `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData` | SwiftData schema, `@Model` types, container factory, adapter implementations, and the full-stack `ManifoldBootstrap`. |

### Backend families (inlets)

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldFoundation` | Apple Foundation Models bridge — gated by OS availability (`#if canImport(FoundationModels)`, iOS 26 / macOS 26+), no trait. Depends on `ManifoldContract` + `ManifoldInference` (the `FoundationBackends` registrar needs the engine). |
| `ManifoldOllama` | Ollama (self-hosted / LAN) backend family: `OllamaBackend`, model list/probe services, NDJSON stream extractor, `OllamaBackends` registrar. Compiles unconditionally. Depends on `ManifoldContract` + `ManifoldCloudCore`. |
| `ManifoldCloudSaaS` | SaaS backend family: Anthropic Claude, OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, LM Studio / custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints, `CloudSaaSBackends` registrar. Compiles unconditionally. Depends on `ManifoldContract` + `ManifoldCloudCore`. |
| `ManifoldCloud` | **Retired** — `import ManifoldCloud` no longer compiles. Use `ManifoldCloudCore` + a provider family, or the `ManifoldKit` umbrella. See docs/MIGRATION-shims-retired.md. |
| `ManifoldCloudCore` | Shared SSE / TLS-pinning / DNS-rebind / URLSession infrastructure (`SSECloudBackend`, `PinnedSessionDelegate`, `DNSRebindingGuard`, `URLSessionProvider`, `CloudErrorSanitizer`, `ThinkingBlockManager`), the provider-agnostic encoding/parsing surface shared by both cloud families, and `DefaultWebSearchRuntime`. Always linked. Depends on `ManifoldInference` + `ManifoldRuntime` (the latter for `DefaultWebSearchRuntime`'s port conformance — an un-gated library→library edge; see Package.swift comment). |
| `ManifoldBackends` | **Retired** — `import ManifoldBackends` and `DefaultBackends` are gone. Import the families directly or the `ManifoldKit` umbrella; pass explicit registrars to `quickStart(backends:)`. See docs/MIGRATION-shims-retired.md. |
| `ManifoldAnyLanguageModel` | **Retired** (#2435) — `import ManifoldAnyLanguageModel` no longer compiles; zero adoption plus dependency coupling to the pre-1.0 external `AnyLanguageModel` package. Reach xAI/Groq/Mistral/OpenRouter (and Gemini models via OpenRouter — Gemini's own endpoint is not reachable through `OpenAIBackend`'s fixed `v1/chat/completions` suffix) via `APIProvider.custom` + `OpenAIBackend`; these hosts also need certificate pinning configured (`PinnedSessionDelegate.pinnedHosts`), unlike the shipped-pinned OpenAI/Anthropic hosts. See docs/MIGRATION-anylanguagemodel-retired.md. |

**Companion packages:** the heavy local-inference families live outside this repo. [`ManifoldKit/manifold-mlx`](https://github.com/ManifoldKit/manifold-mlx) hosts the MLX backend family (text inference, diffusion/image gen, video gen, vendored FluxSwift/StableDiffusion, MLX integration tests); [`ManifoldKit/manifold-llama`](https://github.com/ManifoldKit/manifold-llama) hosts the llama.cpp/GGUF family. Module names stay `ManifoldMLX` / `ManifoldLlama`. Consumers add the companion `.package(...)` and pass registrars: `try await ManifoldKit.quickStart(backends: [LlamaBackends.self])`. Their conventions, hardware constraints, and test docs live in those repos. Building a new companion package? See [docs/COMPANION-BACKENDS.md](docs/COMPANION-BACKENDS.md).

### MCP + tool + app-extension modules

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldMCP` **(Experimental¹)** | Model Context Protocol client surface, descriptors, transports, OAuth, tool bridge (`MCPClient`, `MCPToolSource`). Compiles unconditionally, catalog descriptors included. Depends on `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldMCPHost` **(Experimental¹)** | Runtime-backed MCP server boundary: exposes sessions, messages, RAG documents, and send-message tools to external MCP clients. Depends on `ManifoldMCP` + `ManifoldRuntime`. |
| `ManifoldTools` | End-to-end tool-calling validation harness: fixed reference toolset, declarative scenario runner, JSONL transcript logger. Depends on `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldAppIntents` **(Experimental¹)** | AppIntent ↔ ToolDefinition bridge. Depends on `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldAgentInstructions` **(Experimental¹)** | `AGENTS.md` ambient-instruction filesystem discovery — `AgentInstructionLoader`/`AgentInstructionContextProvider`, a `PromptContextProvider` conformer (macOS-only via `#if os(macOS)`). Extracted from the retired `ManifoldSkills` (#2434) — the only half of that module with a real use case. Depends on `ManifoldInference` only. Wired via `ManifoldKit`'s `ConversationRuntimeOptions.addAgentInstructions(currentDirectory:stoppingAt:)`; see [docs/MIGRATION-skills-removed.md](docs/MIGRATION-skills-removed.md). |
| `ManifoldMacrosPlugin` | Swift macro compiler plugin implementing `@ToolSchema`. Runs at build time (not linked into app binaries). Trait-gated behind `Macros` (off by default) to keep swift-syntax's ~647 files out of default builds. |
| `ManifoldAppEval` | Golden-scenario eval harness for apps built on ManifoldKit (estate#1): scenario schema, turn-loop runner, `CheckpointScorer`, report generation. Depends on `ManifoldInference` + `ManifoldRuntime`. Not re-exported by the `ManifoldKit` umbrella — same precedent as `ManifoldTools`/`ManifoldFuzz`/`ManifoldTelemetryOTLP`; consumers import it explicitly from test targets or dedicated eval executables. See [docs/APP-EVAL.md](docs/APP-EVAL.md). Graduated out of Experimental to Tier 2 (Supported) 2026-08-09 on its first real adopters — fireside (`Packages/FiresideEval`, per-PR `macos-ci.yml`) and idlewick (`iwk` CLI target, `AppEvalReportBuilderTests` CI-executed) — see [docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md](docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md). |

### UI modules

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldUI` | SwiftUI chat-runtime views and view models (chat-only consumer stops here). Depends on `ManifoldRuntime` + `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldUIModelManagement` | Model browser/download/storage UI + cloud API endpoint editors. Depends on `ManifoldUI` + `ManifoldRuntime` + `ManifoldInference` + `ManifoldHuggingFace`. |
| `ManifoldVoice` | Optional speech I/O adapters and voice composer accessory. Depends on `ManifoldUI`. |

### Discovery + server + fuzz

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldHuggingFace` | HuggingFace Hub search, browse, and download integration. Compiles unconditionally. Depends on `ManifoldInference`. |
| `ManifoldServer` | OpenAI-compatible HTTP server executable (Hummingbird). Trait-gated behind `Server`. |
| `ManifoldFuzz` | Fuzzing engine: corpus, runner, capture, detectors, sink. Backend-agnostic; depends on `ManifoldInference`. **Published `.library()` product** — the first external consumer is the manifold-mlx `fuzz-mlx` fuzz/soak driver, which depends on it cross-package; still consumed in-package by `fuzz-chat` / `ManifoldFuzzBackends` / `ManifoldFuzzTests`. |
| `ManifoldFuzzBackends` | Real-backend factory shim for `fuzz-chat` (Ollama / OpenAI / Foundation). Depends on `ManifoldFuzz` + `ManifoldInference` + the backend families. Also not a published product. |
| `fuzz-chat` | Executable driver for fuzz campaigns against Ollama / OpenAI / Foundation / mock / chaos (default backend: ollama). Run via `scripts/fuzz.sh`. |
| `manifold-tools` | CLI executable for running tool-call validation scenarios from `ManifoldTools`. Links `ManifoldOllama` + `ManifoldCloudSaaS` directly (never the umbrella — #982 dual-llama Xcode-scheme hazard). |
| `ManifoldTelemetryOTLP` **(Experimental¹)** | OTLP/HTTP trace exporter. Optional product — not re-exported by the `ManifoldKit` umbrella; consumers add it explicitly and pass an `OTLPTraceSink` to a backend's `traceSink` property. |

¹ Experimental — may break in any minor, always migration-noted; graduates on first
real adopter (a shipping app or companion that pins and imports it). See
docs/API-DESIGN.md § 7b. For the complete maturity picture across every
published product (not just the Experimental ones), see
[docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md](docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS.md).

### Test support targets

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldTestSupport` | Shared mocks and fakes (`MockInferenceBackend`, `CharTokenizer`, etc.). No XCTest dependency (see `ManifoldContractTestSupport`) and no SwiftData/persistence dependency (see `ManifoldPersistenceTestSupport`). Published as a `.library` product so companion backend packages can reuse the mocks. |
| `ManifoldPersistenceTestSupport` | The persistence-dependent test mocks split out of `ManifoldTestSupport`: `GlassBoxDemoRAG`, `InMemoryPersistenceHarness`, and `makeInMemoryContainer()` — the only files that need `SwiftData`/`ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData`. Depends on `ManifoldTestSupport` + `ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData` + `ManifoldRuntime` + `ManifoldInference`. Published as a `.library` product, semver-exempt like its sibling (see docs/API-DESIGN.md § 7). |
| `ManifoldContractTestSupport` | XCTest-dependent protocol contract mixins. Kept separate from `ManifoldTestSupport` so `fuzz-chat` can depend on the latter without pulling XCTest into a non-test binary. |
| `ManifoldBackendTestKit` | Importable backend contract-check machinery (`BackendContractChecks`, backend contract mixins, `FixtureComparator`, local-backend contract runner). Published for companion backend packages. Links XCTest — never depend on it from an executable target (audit-enforced). The capability-claims registry (`BackendContractChecks.ClaimRegistry`) is instance-scoped — owned per test case, not a process-global `static var` — so contract suites that use it are safe under `swift test --parallel` (see its DocC catalog). |

### Umbrella

| Target | Role |
|--------|------|
| `ManifoldKit` | Umbrella re-export so app code can `import ManifoldKit` instead of stitching together 4–6 imports. Re-exports `ManifoldInference` + `ManifoldRuntime` + `ManifoldPersistenceSwiftData` + the backend families (`ManifoldFoundation` / `ManifoldOllama` / `ManifoldCloudSaaS` / `ManifoldCloudCore`) + `ManifoldUI`. `ManifoldModelCatalog` is deliberately *not* a direct edge — consumers reach it transitively via `ManifoldInference`'s `@_exported import`. Specialised modules (`ManifoldUIModelManagement`, `ManifoldHuggingFace`, MCP, Voice, AppIntents, `ManifoldAgentInstructions`, …) stay explicit imports — HF and AgentInstructions are linked internally (seed path / bootstrap wiring bridge respectively) but not `@_exported`, so consumers still import them explicitly. |

**Dependency rules:** Never import any backend family target (`ManifoldFoundation` / `ManifoldOllama` / `ManifoldCloudSaaS`) from UI; never import `ManifoldUIModelManagement` from `ManifoldUI` (CI lint enforces this). `ManifoldUIModelManagement` depends on `ManifoldUI` — cycle dissolved by closure-injecting `APIConfigurationView` via `@ViewBuilder` parameter. All backend-family edges are unconditional; the companion-package families (`ManifoldMLX`, `ManifoldLlama`) depend on this package's `ManifoldInference` from their own repos.

**Trait roster:** there are **no default traits** — plain `swift build` is the full core build. Surviving opt-in traits: `Server`, `Macros`; WWDC stubs `SystemAIProviderExtension`, `CoreAI`. Everything else was retired in the v0.48 train — see docs/MIGRATION-0.48.md; a `traits: ["MLX"]` / `["Llama"]` array now hard-errors at resolve time.

## Running tests

Use `scripts/test.sh` — it runs configured suites and prints an honest summary. There are no default traits since v0.48 — plain `swift test` covers the full core surface (`--disable-default-traits` is obsolete). Key flags:
- `--skip-update` — skips per-invocation git-remote contact (drop only if you edited Package.swift; a brand-new dependency commit fails `--skip-update` lanes with "unable to read tree", so drop the flag on the first run after adding a dep)
- `--traits Server,Macros` — to include the opt-in trait surface
- `--profile local|ci|spike` — named gate shapes (see Pre-push checklist)

**Special cases:**
- Swift Testing must run in a separate process from XCTest (mixing causes libmalloc SIGABRT — see #681)
- MCP E2E: `RUN_MCP_E2E=1 swift test --filter ManifoldMCPE2ESmokeTests` — MCP test targets compile unconditionally (MCP trait retired in v0.48); the `RUN_MCP_E2E=1` env var still gates execution. Filter to the streamable suite; `EverythingServerSmokeTests` has hung 28+ min in past runs.
- Ollama E2E requires Ollama at localhost:11434 (the backend always compiles since v0.48; only the live server is required)
- MLX integration tests and the llama.cpp process-lifecycle constraints moved with the backends — see the manifold-mlx / manifold-llama repos' docs.
- `ManifoldE2ETests`: bare form `swift test --filter ManifoldE2ETests` runs the full suite; for narrower targeting anchor the regex (`--filter 'ManifoldE2ETests\.'` then test name). Bare-vs-anchored behavior shifted in swift-test post-v2.

## Test conventions

For trait conventions, suite layout, classification (Unit / Integration / E2E), and the per-backend conformance walkthrough, see [`Tests/README.md`](Tests/README.md). It is the canonical entry point for "how do I add a backend / test / suite?".

Four cross-cutting QA practices live outside the unit/integration/E2E pyramid — DX walkthroughs, audit tests, the audit sabotage suite, and cold-start conformance gates. See [`docs/QA-PRACTICES.md`](docs/QA-PRACTICES.md) for what each one catches, how to run it, and how to extend it.

- Use `XCTestCase` for new tests; match `@Suite`/`@Test` in files that already use Swift Testing.
- A test that hits SwiftData is an integration test — name and place it accordingly.
- Do not mock the persistence layer. Use in-memory SwiftData stores.
- Async tests: use real `async/await`. Use `XCTestExpectation`/`XCTWaiter` with tight deadlines for callback-based code only.
- After asserting an expected outcome, add a sabotage check to confirm the test fails when the code path breaks. Remove before committing.
- `withKnownIssue` is test debt. Every use requires `// FIXME: <issue URL>` above it. Never in critical E2E paths.
- Never call `MockURLProtocol.reset()` across suites — `canInit(with:)` returns true whenever any stubs are registered (global state). Use UUID-based hostnames per suite (`http://ollama-\(UUID()).test`) to isolate stubs instead.

## Service sharing

`ChatViewModel.inferenceService` is `internal`. Sibling modules read from `ChatViewModel.modelRegistry` (a `@MainActor @Observable ModelRegistry`). Apps needing the same `InferenceService` in multiple components create it at the app level and inject via constructor. Do not widen `inferenceService` past `internal`.

## Turn-loop orchestration

`ConversationRuntime` (`Sources/ManifoldRuntime/Services/ConversationRuntime.swift`) is the single turn loop — owns `send`, `regenerate`, `edit`, `cancel`, and `branch`. No alternative path. Host apps get a configured runtime via `ManifoldBootstrap` and forward user actions to it.

## Public API design policy (pre-1.0)

- **Default to `package`, not `public`.** A new declaration is `package` unless the PR body
  explicitly claims it as public API and says why. `package` access never crosses a package
  boundary, so this default does NOT apply to anything a **companion package**
  (manifold-mlx / manifold-llama), **manifold-eval**, or a **consumer app** conforms to or
  consumes directly — those surfaces must stay `public`, full stop. When unsure whether a
  cross-package consumer exists, check before demoting (grep the companion/eval repos, not just
  this one).
- **Pre-1.0, delete — don't deprecate.** `@available(*, deprecated)` is a post-1.0 tool for
  giving external consumers a migration window; before 1.0 there is no stability promise to
  protect, so a retired API is removed outright, not carried forward with a deprecation shim.
- **Standing review question**: does this diff add a public symbol or knob, and does that knob
  already exist at another layer? (The `TurnConfig`/`GenerationConfig` sampler-parameter
  duplication is the canonical counter-example of what happens when this question isn't asked.)
  Every reviewer — human or agent — asks this before approving a diff that widens public surface.
- See [`docs/API-DESIGN.md`](docs/API-DESIGN.md) for the layer-ownership map and the full
  identity-ranking rationale behind these rules.

## Coding conventions

- **Concurrency**: async/await throughout. No Combine, no callback pyramids.
- **Observable state**: `@Observable` + `@MainActor`. Not `ObservableObject`/`@Published`.

### Swift 6 concurrency gotchas

These patterns either produce `#SendingRisksDataRace` in strict Swift 6 builds or compile while hiding a real race. Fix the isolation boundary instead of silencing the compiler.

1. **Non-isolated `async` helpers that receive `@MainActor`-capturing closures.** A `with*` helper whose body is `() async throws -> R` sends the closure away from the caller's actor. When the body closes over `@MainActor` state, annotate the closure explicitly, for example `try await withErrorHandler({ ... }) { @MainActor in try await container.generate(...) }`. Watch `withTaskGroup`, `withCheckedContinuation`, and pre-Swift-6 library helpers.
2. **`@unchecked Sendable` is not a race fix.** A mutable capture box such as `final class Capture: @unchecked Sendable { var message: String? }` is only safe for synchronous same-thread callbacks read back immediately on the same actor. For escaping callbacks or C/library callbacks that can fire on another thread, use an `actor` or a real lock (`OSAllocatedUnfairLock`/`Mutex` where available).
3. **`@preconcurrency import` is narrow.** It can suppress missing `Sendable` annotations from older libraries, but it does not suppress region-based isolation errors such as the non-isolated closure-sending pattern above. Do not use it as a blanket Swift 6 escape hatch.
4. **`AsyncStream<T>` inherits `T`'s sendability.** `AsyncStream<Generation>` is `Sendable` only while `Generation` is. If an upstream library adds a non-`Sendable` field, errors often appear at call sites; keep explicit stream annotations like `let stream: AsyncStream<Generation> = ...` so failures point at the declaration.
5. **Never use `Task.detached` inside `@MainActor` classes.** `Task { }` inherits the current actor; `Task.detached { }` does not, and the compiler may not warn when it captures mutable `@MainActor` properties. Use `Task { }` and let the callee hop off-actor for expensive non-UI work.
6. **Never block in `deinit` under `@MainActor` ownership.** `DispatchSemaphore.wait()` in `deinit` either freezes the UI or deadlocks the actor. For async C cleanup, mirror `LlamaBackend`'s retain/detach/release pattern: capture the resource strongly into a `Task.detached`, hop off-actor, then release.
7. **Unlocked `nonisolated(unsafe) static var` test-injection seams are not safe by default.** A bare `nonisolated(unsafe) static var` used to let tests inject a mock resolver/hook (e.g. `_resolverForTesting`, a warning hook) is read on the real code path and written by test setup/teardown — with no lock, that's a live cross-thread race under `swift test --parallel`, not just a style nit. Wrong: `nonisolated(unsafe) static var _resolverForTesting: ((String) async -> [String]?)? = nil`. Right: keep the property name (so call sites don't change) but back it with a lock-guarded private storage var, e.g. `private static let overrideLock = NSLock()` + `nonisolated(unsafe) private static var _resolverForTesting_storage: (...)? = nil` + a computed `static var _resolverForTesting` whose `get`/`set` both go through `overrideLock.withLock { ... }` (mirrors `MCPSSRFPolicy`), or `OSAllocatedUnfairLock<T?>` for a single hook (mirrors `CloudImageEncoding._encodeHook`). `UnlockedNonisolatedUnsafeTestSeamAuditTest` is the tripwire; genuinely write-once-before-any-reader flags (documented boot-time config) are the only allowlisted exception.

- **Persistence**: SwiftData only. No CoreData.
- **Error handling**: validate at system boundaries only. Don't guard internal invariants the type system already enforces.
- **Comments**: explain *why*, not *what*.
- **Inject `UserDefaults`.** Production code must accept `userDefaults: UserDefaults = .standard` rather than touching `UserDefaults.standard` directly. `swift test --parallel` (default in CI as of v0.16.1) makes shared-instance access flaky. Bitten twice: #734, #761.
- **Trait gating: gate consumer→library edges, not library→library.** Wrap `M-Tests → M` and `cli-using-M → M` package edges in `.when(traits: ["M"])`. Do NOT gate `M → L` while `M`'s sources still import `L` unconditionally. `PackageTraitGateAuditTest` is a tripwire but doesn't catch every shape — sweep with the trait-combo build below when adding a trait.

## Platform policy

ManifoldKit targets **n-1**: the current Apple OS release and the one immediately before it.

| Platform | Current (n) | Minimum (n-1) |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| macOS    | 26          | 15            |
| iOS      | 26          | 18            |

When Apple ships a new major OS each September, bump both minimums and remove `#available` guards added for the previous floor. Do not use `Atomic`, `OSAllocatedUnfairLock`, or other APIs that post-date the minimum without checking their availability.

**`swift-tools-version` ceiling = installed Xcode toolchain.** Core CI currently selects Xcode 26.3 / Swift 6.3; bumping the tools version above the toolchain CI actually selects breaks `resolve-check` and `fuzz`.

## Hardware constraints (simulator / CI)

The MLX and llama.cpp hardware constraints (global `llama_backend_init`, Metal-in-simulator gating, metallib guards) moved with the backends to the manifold-mlx / manifold-llama repos' docs. What remains relevant to core:

- `FoundationBackend` requires iOS 26 / macOS 26. Gate accordingly.
- Context window capped at 512 tokens in the simulator to avoid OOM.

See [docs/HARDWARE-TOOLCHAIN.md](docs/HARDWARE-TOOLCHAIN.md) for the full cross-repo consolidation (process-global `llama_backend_init`, the #982 dual-llama hazard, Swift Testing/XCTest process separation, toolchain ceiling, CI runner shape).

## Tooling

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/test.sh` | Runs configured Swift test suites and prints an honest summary. |
| `scripts/example-ui-tests.sh` | `build-for-testing` / `test-without-building` for Example app XCUITests. |
| `scripts/clean-leaked-test-artifacts.sh` | Removes test fixtures that leaked into `~/Documents/Models/`. |
| `scripts/clean-build.sh` | Full `.build` wipe + `swift package resolve`. Use when builds fail with "XCFramework Info.plist not found", `workspace-state.json` desync, `build.db` corruption, or "missing required module" errors (e.g. after a rebase — see #2181 preflight detector in `scripts/test.sh`). |
| `scripts/fuzz.sh` | Runs the ManifoldFuzz harness (default: 5 min against Ollama). CI cadence: **weekly only** (`.github/workflows/fuzz-weekly.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`). PR / nightly / hosted-heartbeat tiers were retired 2026-05 — once a backend is mature the fuzzer goes quiet for months, so per-PR + nightly CI minutes did not pay off. Run `scripts/fuzz.sh` locally (and consider temporarily reintroducing a higher cadence) when adding a new backend or model family. |
| `scripts/test-ios-simulator.sh` | Runs `ModelContainerFileProtectionTests` on an iOS Simulator via xcodebuild. Required because `NSFileProtection*` is an iOS-only kernel feature skipped by the macOS `swift test` lane. |
| `scripts/local-integration-sweep.sh` | Repeatable real-model integration + perf sweep across core (Ollama E2E) + manifold-llama (5-family GBNF conformance) + manifold-mlx (text/vision/benchmark) on local Apple Silicon. Run by hand (not scheduled) the nights you want real-hardware signal CI can't produce. See [docs/QA-PRACTICES.md § 5](docs/QA-PRACTICES.md). |
| `scripts/api-demotion-screen.sh <TypeName> <Module>` | The A.0 verification screen for a public→package demotion candidate: source-restricted consumer-repo grep (type name + public members), an in-repo signature-anchor heuristic, and a docs/DocC check, printed as PASS/FAIL/NEEDS-HAND-ADJUDICATION evidence for the demotion PR body. |

**SwiftPM local-package consumers need explicit `name:`.** When adding `.package(path: ...)` references (worktrees, cold-start gates, scratch consumers), pass `name: "ManifoldKit"` explicitly — `.package(path:)` derives identity from the last path component, which breaks under non-default checkout paths.

## Pre-push checklist

**Pre-push (local, Apple Silicon):**

```bash
scripts/test.sh --profile local
```

Runs XCTest + Swift Testing on the full core surface plus the `Macros` trait. Three-invocation shape is preserved internally (XCTest filters, then `ManifoldBackendsTests` in its own process with `--parallel`, then `ManifoldInferenceSwiftTestingTests` in a separate process — mixing the two runners in one process triggers libmalloc SIGABRT, #681). `ManifoldBackendsTests` gets its own invocation because that target mixes XCTest with Swift Testing files, so batching it with the other XCTest suites reintroduces the #681 hazard (#2299). Within that own process, `--parallel` is on: the capability-claims registry is instance-scoped per test case (arch-plan item 4.2), so the historical process-global race (#1601) is gone — see `ManifoldBackendTestKit`'s DocC catalog. The multi-target XCTest batch also runs `--parallel`, matching ci.yml's test job's parallel execution — it historically omitted the flag as a conservative default, which let parallel-only races (SwiftData teardown, process-global state) pass locally and fail CI (#2329). If a parallel-only race surfaces in the local gate, fix the test's isolation; never realign by removing the flag. One counting caveat: the parallel runner folds XCTSkip results into the passed count (per-case skip lines aren't reliably emitted), so invocation 1's "0 skipped" is a reporting artifact, not a skip audit — `TestSuiteSilentSkipAuditTest` is the skip tripwire.

**Each of the three invocations is routed through `scripts/ci-test-with-watchdog.sh`** — the same wrapper CI uses, not a reimplementation — so a hung test SIGABRTs locally instead of just looking slow (a dev machine absorbs subprocess load differently than a CI runner, which is exactly how four locally-green `--profile local` runs failed to predict a CI stall in one night). Default stall threshold is **480s (2x CI's 240s)**, deliberate headroom for legitimate local contention (a second concurrent gate, Xcode indexing, SwiftPM cache-lock contention) without defeating the point — a genuine hang is silent forever, so even 480s still catches it. `--profile ci` keeps CI's own 240s by default, since its purpose is reproducing a CI failure at CI's own threshold. Override either with `STALL_SECONDS=<n>`. The watchdog fails closed: a missing/non-executable wrapper aborts the gate rather than silently running unprotected, and the only way to skip it (`MANIFOLD_DISABLE_LOCAL_WATCHDOG=1`) prints a loud warning banner every time, so an unprotected run is never mistaken for a protected one.

**Pre-push (CI repro — only when chasing a CI failure):**

```bash
scripts/test.sh --profile ci
```

Mirrors CI's three-invocation shape exactly. Use only when reproducing a CI failure; pre-push correctness is `--profile local`.

Both profiles respect explicit caller flags: `scripts/test.sh --profile local --filter ManifoldCoreTests` runs *just* that suite, but under the local trait set and worker count. `scripts/test.sh` is the source of truth for the gate shape — the long literal command no longer lives here.

**Spike gate** (bounded changes only): `scripts/test.sh --profile spike --spike-module <suite>` — runs `swift build --build-tests` + only the affected suite. Valid only when the diff touches one module and you've run the full suite once already on this branch. Full `--profile local` gate is mandatory before the final push and after any rebase.

**What else qualifies for the spike gate.** Beyond "one module's Swift source", a diff qualifies when it touches **only hand-edited data files whose executing suite(s) are fully and explicitly known via `scripts/affected-suites.sh`'s per-file `case` mappings** — not the blanket directory rules, which name a suite but not a bound on what else in the diff might matter. "Fully and explicitly known" means the resolver's actual output, not just who reads the file: run it and check. The worked example: `scripts/demo-coverage-manifest.tsv` / `scripts/demo-coverage-baseline.tsv` is only *read* by `DemoCoverageGateAuditTest` (`ManifoldCoreTests`, via `scripts/demo-coverage.sh --check`), but the resolver does not stop there —
```console
$ printf 'scripts/demo-coverage-manifest.tsv\nscripts/demo-coverage-baseline.tsv\n' | scripts/affected-suites.sh
...
force-include audit anchors: ManifoldCoreTests ManifoldInferenceTests (#2290)
ManifoldCoreTests ManifoldInferenceTests
```
`ManifoldInferenceTests` rides along because the resolver unconditionally force-includes both audit-anchor suites (#2290) whenever anything else was selected — a `case`-mapped file is enough to trigger it, whether or not `ManifoldInferenceTests` itself reads that file. So the spike run for this shape has to name both: `scripts/test.sh --profile spike --spike-module 'ManifoldCoreTests|ManifoldInferenceTests'` (`--spike-module` threads straight into `swift test --filter`, which accepts a regex alternation) — owner-sanctioned in #2455 and #2459, both data-only manifest edits. Two conditions apply on top of the mapping itself, both required:
- **the same tree has a green full `--profile local` (or `--profile ci`) gate somewhere in the current branch's history** — the spike run is topping up coverage for a bounded diff on top of a tree already proven, not substituting for first-time validation;
- **any rebase re-triggers the full gate.** A rebase changes the tree the spike run's "already proven" claim was about; the spike shortcut does not survive it.

This does not widen the "diff touches one module" spike condition above it — it names a second, narrow shape (data files whose full resolver output — including any force-included anchors, not just direct readers — is known ahead of time) that the mapping already makes legible. **When in doubt, run the full gate.** A file whose blast radius isn't nailed down by an explicit `case` in `affected-suites.sh` — only the blanket directory rules, or nothing — does not qualify, however small the diff looks.

**Optional-traits sweep** (whenever modifying a switched enum, a `GenerationEvent` / `GenerationConfig` / `BackendCapabilities`-shaped type, or any trait-gated source file):
```bash
swift build --build-tests --traits Server,Macros
```
Plain builds won't catch Server/Macros-gated switch exhaustiveness. The all-traits-on `--build-tests` is the cheapest single check.

CI runs on macOS runners. The repo is public, so standard-runner minutes are free — the cost of a red or redundant run is **latency**: GitHub caps concurrent macOS jobs org-wide, and one `ci.yml` run fans out up to 5 macOS jobs, so every wasted run delays other queued work (including parallel sessions' PRs). Test locally first.

When changing behavior of any function or type, grep for ALL test references across `Tests/` — not just the obvious test file.

## Error handling

Never trap a recoverable condition. This is a property, not a fixed list of banned identifiers: `fatalError`, `assertionFailure`, `precondition`, and `preconditionFailure` all crash the process — `precondition`/`preconditionFailure` in release builds too, not just `swift test` — so none of the four belong on a path where the trapped condition can plausibly occur at runtime with a viable fallback (throw, log + safe default, or a compile-time-enforced init parameter). A trap is **wrong** (must be replaced with a recoverable path) if **either**: (A) the value can change *during the process's lifetime* after the guarded code path was already reached safely — a runtime toggle, a dynamically-flippable feature flag; **or** (B) **both** of the following hold together — (B1) the value can originate from outside the programmer's control (a config file, a defaults key, a runtime-filtered list, a value forwarded through public API that a separate caller drives with its own data) **and** (B2) a resulting crash lands in a shipped app running on someone else's device, not just in the developer's own process (a build, a test run, a CLI/fuzz tool they're driving directly). B1 and B2 must **both** hold for that branch to apply — B1 alone is not enough, which is the subtlety that made this rule hard to get right. The asymmetry between (A) and (B) — (A) alone always disqualifies a trap, (B) needs both clauses — is not arbitrary: a value that can change *during the process's lifetime* means the trap fires at a moment unrelated to the mistake that caused it, so the "immediate, clear feedback right next to the error" justification for trapping evaporates even for a developer debugging their own process. A caller-supplied constant, by contrast, traps at construction, right next to the wiring mistake that caused it — genuinely useful feedback when the blast radius stays inside the developer's own process, which is exactly what B2 failing means. Don't unify the two branches into one symmetric test; the justification differs for each. `URLSessionProvider.networkDisabled` is wrong under (A) — it's a "belt-and-suspenders" runtime kill-switch that can flip at any point during process lifetime, and used to be implemented with `precondition`, so a caller could trip it by simply constructing a cloud backend, crashing the whole host app instead of failing one request. `RedirectGuardDelegate.hopCap`, `FallbackBackend`'s empty-chain check, and `DocumentChunker`'s chunkSize/overlap are wrong under (B) — each is fixed once at construction (not A), but each is public API fed from host-app-controlled runtime data (config, a `filter { $0.isReady }`-built list, `RAGConfiguration` read by `ManifoldBootstrap`) reachable from a shipped app's own bootstrap path, satisfying both B1 and B2. `RotatingFuzzFactory(children:blockSize:)` is a useful near-miss: it satisfies B1 (`ManifoldFuzz` is a published `.library()` product a companion package can construct programmatically with no human at a terminal) but **not** B2 (`ManifoldFuzz` never ships inside a consumer app — a bad value crashes the fuzz operator's own process immediately with a clear message, not a stranger's device with no way to diagnose it), so neither (A) nor (B) applies and the trap is correct — B1 alone is exactly the trap the next reader will fall into if this is read as a single-clause rule. `TrappingConstructAuditTest` (in `ManifoldInferenceTests`) enforces this across all four constructs; `trapping_construct_allowlist.txt` next to it records the per-site reasoning for the constructs that stay (every kept site fails to trigger both A and B). Use `Log.*` for the fallback path. Reserve trapping constructs for true programmer errors with no recovery path.

`try?` is banned in production code. `SilentCatchAuditTest` (in `ManifoldInferenceTests`) fails CI if `try?` appears in error-propagation paths. Use `do/catch` with `Log.*` so the error is visible. Optional decoding at trust boundaries is the only legitimate exception.

Shell scripts are held to the same standard: `ScriptFailOpenAuditTest` (in `ManifoldCoreTests`) flags fail-open idioms in `scripts/` — a missing `set -euo pipefail` header, `set +e` never re-armed, and `|| true` swallows outside a small tolerant-command idiom set (`grep`, `kill`, `rm`, …), with **no** idiom escape for masked load-bearing producers (`swift build|test|run`, `xcodebuild`). A genuine tolerance carries `# fail-open-ok: <reason>` on or just above the line; a bare marker with no reason is itself flagged.

## Documentation gates

Docs are held to the same tripwire standard as code (Principle 4). Three layers,
each with a different failure mode:

| Layer | Authoritative audit | Catches | Blocks a merge? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Form** | `DocsAudienceStatusAuditTest` | missing `**Audience:**` / `**Status:**` header | **yes** — required `test`, mirrored on docs-only PRs by `scripts/lint-docs-headers.sh` under required `lint` |
| **Claims** | `DocClaimsAuditTest` | a `` ``Symbol`` `` that no longer exists, a broken relative `.md` link, a dead `#anchor`, a `docs/*.md` nothing references | **yes** — same shape, mirrored by `scripts/lint-doc-claims.sh` |
| **Snippets — policy** | `scripts/extract-snippets.sh` | a bare `no-build`, a doc where every block is skipped, a skip-budget change | **yes** — `snippet-policy-lint` under required `lint` |
| **Snippets — compile** | `scripts/extract-snippets-test.sh` | a fenced `swift` block that does not compile as published | **no — advisory** (see below) |

**Why each doc-driven audit needs a `lint` mirror.** `ci.yml`'s macOS `test` job
is paths-filtered and excludes `docs/**`, and `scripts/affected-suites.sh` keeps
the affected-suite set empty for docs-only diffs — so a docs-only PR never runs
these audits on the PR head; the CI Required Test Shim reports `test` green in
their place. `merge_group` has no paths filter, so the first failure lands
*inside the queue* and poisons the batch (#2306 took #2212 down six times).
`lint` is ubuntu, required, and has no `pull_request` paths filter, so a mirror
there catches it on the PR run. **A new markdown-driven audit ships with a
`lint` mirror, or it does not block on the PRs that can break it.**

The same gap existed for **shell scripts**: `ci.yml`'s paths were an allowlist of
~12 named scripts, so most `scripts/*.sh` edits never triggered CI, and
`affected-suites.sh` resolved a scripts-only diff to `NONE` — meaning
`ScriptFailOpenAuditTest`, which scans all of `scripts/`, first ran in the merge
queue. `ci.yml` now globs `scripts/**.sh` (kept in lockstep with
`ci-required-test-shim.yml`'s `paths-ignore` — the `shim-drift` lint step
enforces that pair, and the same step also locks
`example-ui-build-check.yml` ↔ `example-ui-build-required-shim.yml` for the
required `build-for-testing` context, #2377) and the resolver force-includes
`ManifoldCoreTests` for any `scripts/*.sh` change.

**The rule: a suite that reads or executes a file must be selected when that file
changes.** Two enforcement shapes, both in `affected-suites.sh`:

- *Scans a whole directory* → a blanket rule. `ScriptFailOpenAuditTest` scans all
  of `scripts/`, so any `scripts/*.sh` edit selects `ManifoldCoreTests`.
- *Executes one specific script* → an explicit `case` mapping, alongside the
  existing `api-surface-baseline.sh` → `APIFreezeTests` entry:
  `fuzz-ci-gate.sh` → `ManifoldFuzzTests`, `check-readme.sh` →
  `ManifoldInferenceTests`.

That second list is **hand-kept and has no tripwire** — nothing detects a new
script-executing test that forgets its mapping. If you add one, add the mapping
in the same PR; if that keeps being forgotten, the fix is an audit that greps
`Tests/` for `scripts/` invocations and asserts each has an entry.

Rules when editing docs:

- **Removing a public API means updating every doc that names it**, not just the
  README. `DocClaimsAuditTest`'s symbol check is the tripwire; the PR template
  carries the grep. This exists because PR #2007 deleted `ManifoldVoice`'s
  wake-word subsystem and `docs/QUICKSTART-VOICE.md` advertised it for five more
  weeks — see [docs/MIGRATION-wake-word-removed.md](docs/MIGRATION-wake-word-removed.md).
- **Snippet coverage is derived, not enumerated.** Every `README.md`,
  `AGENTS.md`, and `docs/*.md` is swept unless it is in
  `SNIPPET_GATE_OPT_OUT` in `scripts/extract-snippets.sh`, with a reason. Adding
  a doc does not require registering it anywhere; excluding one is a reviewable
  line. Do not reintroduce a filename list — the old one grew reactively eight
  times and still missed `AGENTS.md`, and a second copy of it (`INPUTS=()`) sat
  dead in the same file for months.
- **`no-build` carries a reason**: ```` ```swift,no-build:<why> ````. A bare tag
  is rejected, exactly as `ScriptFailOpenAuditTest` rejects a bare `|| true` —
  same hazard (a free, invisible opt-out), same remedy. Legacy bare tags are
  budgeted per-doc by **`scripts/snippet-skip-baseline.tsv`**: a **ratchet**, so a
  doc may keep the skips it had and never gain one. A genuinely new fragment
  requires bumping its count — that bump is a reviewable line, which is exactly
  the visibility a bare tag never had. Regenerate with
  `scripts/extract-snippets.sh --update-baseline`, and say in the PR why any count
  went up. **A doc with no compiling block at all fails the gate** (once its bare
  count reaches 0) — it would otherwise cost a full macOS run per edit and verify
  nothing.
- **A doc's snippets compile as published.** The harness deliberately injects no
  imports: if a reader must paste an `import` the snippet omits, the snippet is
  wrong. Prefer making a block self-contained over tagging it.

### When an RCA's primary fix is declined, record the decision

`scripts/dx-walkthrough/runs/2026-05-23_v0.33.0/01-chat-cli/ROOT_CAUSES.md`
identified `no-build` overloading as a root cause, offered a structural fix
(split the tag) and an *"Or simpler:"* heading lint, and warned the cheap option
*"[does] nothing for the next snippet that's tagged `no-build` because someone
didn't want to wrestle with the gate."* The cheap option shipped; the predicted
recurrence landed four weeks later and went unnoticed for five more.

So: declining an RCA's leading prescription is a legitimate call, but it is a
**decision to record** — in the PR body, with what will catch the recurrence
instead. The cheaper variant always looks sufficient on the day.

## Commit style

Conventional Commits. Release Please reads these for version bumps.

```
feat: add streaming cancellation to FoundationBackend
fix: prevent context overflow when system prompt exceeds budget
perf: cache tokenizer lookups in ContextWindowManager
test: add XCTMeasure baselines for trimMessages hot path
chore: update swift-huggingface to 0.6.0
```

- `feat` → MINOR, `fix` → PATCH, `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → MAJOR, everything else → no release
- **CI lints PR titles** (squash-merge means Release Please reads the PR title, not branch commits). Individual branch commits should follow the format but aren't linted.

## Release workflow

Release Please auto-creates a release PR after `feat:`/`fix:` merges. The auto-generated bullets **must be rewritten** before merging — `changelog-lint` CI and a pre-merge hook both block until done.

Use **Prisma-style Highlights format** (adopted v0.11.2, PR #649): `### Highlights` with short verb-led headlines, 2–3 sentences of context, and a runnable code snippet for new/changed public APIs. Small features and fixes go as one-line bullets under `### Features`/`### Fixes`. Pre-0.11.2 entries stay in their original format.

Workflow: check out the release branch via its worktree, rewrite CHANGELOG.md, amend + force-push, then merge through the queue: `gh pr merge <N> --squash --auto` (same rule as feature PRs — no `--admin`, no `gh api` direct merge; the queue validates the release commit against current main and the post-merge CI run self-skips).

**Rewrite last, and merge promptly — Release Please silently overwrites the rewrite.** Any
`feat:`/`fix:` merging to `main` while the release PR is open causes Release Please to regenerate
the branch, discarding a hand-written CHANGELOG with no warning and no conflict. This has already
eaten one rewrite (a 0.73.0 draft written 2026-07-18 was regenerated away when the UI-refresh and
history-hints PRs landed, and its "0.74.0 ships the refresh" pre-announcement silently became
false). So: do the Highlights rewrite as the **last** step before merging, not days ahead, and if
the release PR sits open for a while, re-check that your prose is still on the branch — and still
*true* — before merging.

**Pre-bump demo-app gate (mandatory before merging the release PR):** run `scripts/demo-apps-build.sh` — it builds both example apps (Advanced iOS, Minimal iOS + macOS) and must be green. The demos consume ManifoldKit by local path, so package drift (retired traits, renamed modules, iOS-unavailable symbols pulled in via the `ManifoldKit` umbrella) breaks them while `swift test` stays green — `swift test` builds for macOS only, so iOS-only API unavailability is invisible to it. This gate is **release-time, not per-PR**: demo breakage is rare and the xcodebuild runs are slow, so paying for them once per release (not per PR) is the right trade. Do not bump the version if it fails.

**Pre-bump companion-canary gate — CI-ENFORCED, hard-blocking, no override flag.**
`scripts/companion-canary-check.sh` reports whether manifold-mlx and manifold-llama still build
against core `main`, and fails on a red canary *or* one that didn't cover the commits being
released (`--dispatch` triggers fresh runs and waits; see the event split below for when CI uses
which mode). Staleness is **commit-relative, not wall-clock**: a canary that started before
`origin/main`'s tip commit never tested it, however recent it is — a pure age window would have
passed the very incident below, since the last green ran 21 minutes *before* the seam-moving
commit landed. Principle 9 requires known consumers to be built against a change before it ships;
the demo gate covers the example apps, and this covers the companion packages. Each companion
already runs a `Canary (core main)` workflow (nightly + on `core-release` + on demand) — the
signal existed long before this gate did, which is the point: on 2026-07-20 that canary went red
at 07:29 with `cannot find type 'StructuredHistoryReceiver'`, v0.73.0 merged at 09:14:33Z and
published 10s later anyway, and both companions were stranded a minor behind until their
adaptation PRs landed. As of the `feat/release-readiness-gate` change, a red canary **hard-blocks**
the release via `.github/workflows/lint.yml`'s `lint` job, with deliberately no override flag:
shipping past a red canary requires landing the companions' adaptation PRs in lockstep first (§
"Companion pin-bump releases" below), not a judgment call made in the moment of merging.

**Why the canary CI step is `pull_request` only (no `merge_group` re-read) — a second
finding, distinct from the CI-dark one below, and just as easy to "simplify" away wrongly.** The
script's primary check is landing-relative freshness: a canary that started before `origin/main`'s
current tip merged is STALE regardless of age. Each companion canaries nightly plus on-demand, so
at release time `main` has almost always moved since the last nightly — a naive gate that only ever
reads the last-known result would read STALE on nearly every release, not just on real breakage,
and a gate that's red every time is a gate operators route around (exactly the failure this whole
change exists to prevent). So the `lint` job dispatches on the one event that actually executes
on the release branch:
- **On `pull_request`** (in practice, Rory's changelog-rewrite force-push — the one bot-independent
  moment on the release-please branch that actually executes; see the CI-dark writeup below) it runs
  `scripts/companion-canary-check.sh --dispatch`, which triggers fresh canary runs on both
  companions and waits for them. This needs the `COMPANION_DISPATCH_TOKEN` repo secret (the same
  fine-grained PAT `notify-companions` in `release-please.yml` uses — the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
  cannot fire a cross-repo `workflow_dispatch` any more than it can a cross-repo
  `repository_dispatch`); if that secret is unset the step **fails outright** rather than silently
  falling back to a read-only check that would then pass on stale evidence.
- **On `merge_group` it deliberately does not run at all.** An earlier revision put a read-only
  check here on the theory that `merge_group` is "the run that actually blocks". Review showed that
  gate cannot work. Freshness is graded against `origin/main`'s tip *at the moment the script runs*,
  and in a `merge_group` run that tip is main **without** the release PR — a value that changes every
  time anything else merges. Concretely: force-push at 09:45 dispatches canaries at ~09:50; an
  unrelated batch merges at 10:25; the release batch validates at 10:30; the 09:50 canary now
  predates the 10:25 tip, reads STALE, and the batch is ejected — and re-dispatching restarts the
  identical race. Main's median inter-commit gap is ~95 minutes with 44% of gaps under an hour, so
  that is a routine outcome, not a corner case. It would have re-created the always-red gate this
  design exists to avoid.

**The `pull_request` step is the blocking one, and that is sufficient.** `lint` is a required status
check, so the release PR cannot be queued until that run is green, and `--dispatch` makes its
evidence genuinely fresh at that moment. What is *not* covered is main moving between that check and
the merge. That is **not** the same exposure every other pre-merge check carries: those validate
this PR's own content and the queue re-validates the merged tree. This gate's subject is external
repos versus `main` — a target that moves independently of the PR — so after dropping the queue
re-read it is the only release-relevant gate with no merged-tree validation. The window is
narrowed from ~24h (nightly) to the PR-check-to-merge gap; it is not closed. Do not "fix" it by
adding a `merge_group` canary step; that is the race above.

**If the `pull_request` check reds on staleness**, the usual cause is that nobody has force-pushed
the changelog rewrite yet — only the CI-dark bot regenerations have touched the branch, so the
dispatch step never ran. Two other causes are now distinguishable rather than presenting as the same
"STALE" message: the `COMPANION_DISPATCH_TOKEN` secret being unset (the step fails outright), and the
token being present but under-scoped, which the script now reports as a named dispatch failure and
exits non-zero on instead of quietly grading the previous run. `gh workflow run` needs **Actions:
read+write** on the companion repos, which is a *different* permission from the `contents` scope
`repository_dispatch` needs — a PAT minted only for `notify-companions` will 403 here.

**Why this lives in `lint`'s `pull_request`/`merge_group` triggers, not a dedicated release
workflow — a finding worth preserving, because the next reader will otherwise "simplify" this into
something that never runs.** The release-please branch
(`release-please--branches--main`) is empirically CI-dark:
- **Zero `push`-event workflow runs have ever fired on it.** Nothing in this repo's workflow
  triggers on `push` to that branch, so a check gated on `push` would never execute.
- **Every `github-actions[bot]`-actor `pull_request` run on it sits at conclusion
  `action_required` and never executes.** Measured 2026-08-09 over the 500 most recent workflow
  runs on that branch (2026-07-12 → 2026-08-09, `gh api 'repos/ManifoldKit/ManifoldKit/actions/runs?
  branch=release-please--branches--main&per_page=100&page=N'`): 450 bot-actor runs sat at
  `action_required`, only 5 bot-actor runs ever completed, and all 45 completed runs were
  `roryford`-actor — i.e. the manual changelog-rewrite force-push is the only thing that has ever
  made CI run there. (A narrower "94 runs total over the 0.73.0/0.74.0 cycles" figure appears
  elsewhere in this doc, from an earlier, differently-scoped count across a fixed 6-workflow list —
  both stand; this bullet's figure is the current, reproducible one.) A check gated to fire only on
  a bot regeneration would silently never run under this repo's Actions settings.
- **`merge_group` runs always execute to completion** (actor `roryford`, every recent run
  succeeded), and `lint` (the job, not a specific step) is one of exactly three required status
  contexts on `main` (`test`, `lint`, `api-digester-check`) under the merge queue's ALLGREEN
  grouping strategy.

Given those three facts, a step added inside the existing `lint` job's `pull_request`/`merge_group`
triggers is the *only* placement that both (a) actually executes on the release PR and (b) blocks
the merge — with no new required-context registration needed. Registering a brand-new required
context is a known trap in this repo: `readme-snippets` has sat un-required for exactly that
reason (see "Documentation gates" above).

Detection of "is this run validating a release" is a `release-context` step in that job with **two
necessary conditions**, not one — do not simplify this back to a bare version comparison, which
reintroduces a real false-positive window (found in review):
1. `version.txt` is valid SemVer and strictly newer than the latest published tag
   (`gh api repos/.../releases/latest`); an older-but-unequal branch is not a release.
2. The change actually under validation modifies `version.txt` itself — diffed against
   `github.event.merge_group.base_sha`/`head_sha` on `merge_group`, or against
   `origin/${{ github.base_ref }}` on `pull_request` (same idiom as the `dep-budget`/
   `large-file-guard` steps in the same job).

**Why condition 2 exists**: after the release PR merges, `main`'s `version.txt` already reads the
new version, but `releases/latest` still returns the previous tag until `release-please.yml`'s
push-triggered run creates the new tag — a window of minutes, longer if that job queues or fails.
Any unrelated PR whose `merge_group` run lands inside that window would satisfy condition 1 alone
and wrongly fire both release-only gates on a change that has nothing to do with the release —
`migration-index-gate` in particular would red on `next` rows that are entirely legitimate on
`main` right after a release (new notes land right around when old ones get flipped). That is the
flaky-required-gate pattern this whole change exists to eliminate; requiring condition 2 too closes
the window, since only the actual release PR (and the merge-queue candidate built from it) ever
modifies `version.txt`.

The whole step **fails closed** on either condition: an API error, empty/missing `version.txt`, or
an unresolvable diff (unresolvable `base_sha`/`head_sha`, a failed base-ref fetch, a diff that
lists zero changed files when a real diff was expected) fails the job rather than guessing — never
defaulting to "not a release" (which would silently disable the gates) and never defaulting to
"is a release" (which would red an unrelated PR). Both signals are logged independently in the
step output so a future reader can see which one decided the outcome.

**Migration-index gate — CI-ENFORCED, release-only.** The same `lint` job runs
`scripts/migration-index-check.sh --release` whenever a release is detected, and fails if any row
in `docs/MIGRATION-INDEX.md`'s Release column still says `next` — every migration note must have
its `next` placeholder flipped to the real version before that version ships (RELEASE.md's
changelog-rewrite step is where this happens by hand).

The completeness half (no `--release`) runs on **every** `lint` run, not just releases. Its
authoritative tripwire is `MigrationIndexAuditTest`, but that audit is markdown-driven, and this
file's own rule — "a new markdown-driven audit ships with a `lint` mirror, or it does not block on
the PRs that can break it" (see "Documentation gates" above) — applies to it exactly. A PR adding a
migration note with no index row is typically docs-only: `ci.yml`'s `pull_request` paths carry no
`docs/**` entry, so the required `test` job is satisfied by the shim in seconds and
`affected-suites.sh` resolves the diff to `NONE`. Without the mirror the audit would first execute
inside the merge queue and poison the batch — the #2306 shape. Do not make the completeness step
release-conditional to "save time"; it costs one shell invocation and it is the only thing that runs
it on the PRs that break it.

**The two release-only gates are split by event, and the reason is not the same for each.** Do not
collapse them back to "both PR-only" for symmetry.

- *Companion canary* stays `pull_request` only. A `merge_group` re-check could catch main moving
  between the PR check and the merge — a real signal, but one swamped by false positives, because
  freshness is graded against a main tip that changes with every unrelated merge (worked timeline
  above). Do not add a `merge_group` canary step.
- *Migration index `--release` also runs on `merge_group`.* Any `next` row in the tree about to be
  tagged is a true positive: that note ships in this version. A note that lands on `main` after the
  changelog rewrite, or rides in the same merge-queue batch as the release PR, is included in the
  tagged commit and will still say `next` unless the queue re-checks. The canary's
  STALE-vs-moving-tip argument does not transfer. If a new note is in the same batch as a release,
  flip its row in that batch (it is shipping) — do not treat `| next |` as legitimate inside a
  release candidate.

`README.md` install-pin examples (`from: "x.y.z"`) are bumped automatically by Release Please via the `extra-files` entry in `release-please-config.json` — do not update them manually between releases.

`changelog-lint` accepts: `^### ` (Prisma subheading) or `^\*\*[^*]+\*\* — ` (legacy bold+em-dash). Rejects any unrewritten `* lowercase` Release Please bullet.

**Release Please can silently drop a whole commit from the changelog** (#2380): its commit
parser hard-fails on a squashed body whenever an identifier is immediately followed by nested
parentheses (e.g. Swift code like `exit(FuzzReport.exitCode(for: report))`) and the failure is
logged only at debug level, so the entire PR — not just the offending paragraph — vanishes with
no visible warning. Two independent, differently-scoped guards exist against this — don't
conflate them:
- **CI gate (`lint.yml`'s `changelog-parser-check`, blocking):** re-runs release-please's own
  commit parser (`scripts/changelog-parser-check.sh`) over every releasable commit since the
  previous tag and reds on any commit the parser itself can't handle — the defect directly, not
  a proxy for it. Never looks at `CHANGELOG.md`'s content, so it has no editorial-omission
  false-positive surface and fires on every push to the release PR, any actor, any event.
- **Manual pre-rewrite check (`scripts/changelog-coverage-check.sh`, not wired into CI):**
  cross-checks `CHANGELOG.md`'s newest section text against every non-hidden-type commit —
  useful only while that section still holds release-please's own generated bullets, never
  against the hand-rewritten Highlights (which is allowed to omit bullets editorially). Run it
  by hand before starting the rewrite (RELEASE.md's changelog-rewrite step); it is not a CI gate because it can't
  reliably observe "still generated" state in CI on this branch — see the next paragraph.

**Bot-triggered workflow runs on the release-please branch never execute** (found while building
the above): every `github-actions[bot]`-actor run on `release-please--branches--main` — both the
0.73.0 and 0.74.0 cycles, all 6 workflows that trigger on it (`Lint`, `CI`, `CI Required Test
Shim`, `CodeQL`, `README Snippets`, `cold-start-human`), 94 runs total — sits at `conclusion:
action_required` and is never approved; only `roryford`-actor pushes on that branch ever
complete (`gh api repos/ManifoldKit/ManifoldKit/actions/runs?branch=release-please--branches--main`).
This silently shapes what any release-branch CI gate can be built on: a check gated to fire only
on a release-please regeneration (a bot `synchronize`) will never actually run in practice under
these settings, however correct its logic — this is why `changelog-parser-check` above is
deliberately gated on *any* actor, not on detecting a bot push. `changelog-lint` (already merged,
already required, already gated on the release-please branch regardless of actor) has the same
exposure and has always only gotten a real verdict from Rory's own push, not release-please's.

**Capability-field release-notes discipline:** a release that adds a new `BackendCapabilities`
field ships a one-line CHANGELOG callout — "new capability field `X`, default `Y` — backends
that support `X` must opt in." New fields default to their old-behavior value, so a companion
backend (manifold-mlx / manifold-llama) that doesn't yet construct the literal with the new
field silently reports the default rather than failing to compile; the callout is the only
signal that tells a companion maintainer opt-in is available and expected.

**Platform-floor release-notes discipline (post-1.0):** raising the iOS/macOS deployment
floor is a **minor**, not a major ([`docs/RELEASE-1.0.md` Policy 1](docs/RELEASE-1.0.md)),
and ships a one-line CHANGELOG callout **one release ahead of the bump** — "the next minor
raises the floor to iOS `X` / macOS `Y`; pin to `x.y.z` to stay on the current floor." The
n-1 policy lands this every September and no gate can predict it, so it is a hand-kept step:
a consumer who must stay on an old OS needs the warning *before* their resolve breaks, not
in the notes of the release that broke it. Whoever cuts the release preceding a floor bump
writes the notice.

**Companion pin-bump releases (`deps:`, not `fix:`).** Every core `feat:`/`fix:` release
fans out via the org-shared `companion-core-bump.yml` (in `ManifoldKit/.github`) into a pin
bump on manifold-mlx and manifold-llama: those repos pin `.upToNextMinor(from: …)`, so a new
core **minor** falls outside their window and a consumer wanting both-at-latest can't resolve
until the companion republishes. That republish is genuinely forced, but it carries **no
functional change** — so it must not read as a bug fix. The shared workflow commits it as
`deps: bump ManifoldKit pin to vX.Y.Z` with a `Release-As:` trailer that forces the patch
(release-please only auto-cuts for `feat`/`fix`, so a bare `deps:` would produce no release).
It renders under a **Dependencies** CHANGELOG heading, kept visible by the explicit
`changelog-sections` in each companion's `release-please-config.json` — release-please's
empty-config default silently *discards* unlisted types like `deps`. The forced patch is used
only when the caller trips release-please **and** the pin bump is the sole releasable commit
since the last tag; if any `feat`/`fix`/breaking change is already queued, a forced patch+1
could under-version it (patch instead of its minor — notably once a companion reaches 1.0),
so the commit falls back to `fix(deps):` and lets release-please compute the version.

**Companion release PRs are the one documented direct-merge carve-out** (an explicit, narrow
exception to the "no `--admin`, no `gh api` direct merge" rule above — note it uses the `gh api`
form, not `--admin`). A companion's own
`chore(main): release X` PR touches only `CHANGELOG.md` and `.release-please-manifest.json` —
both in its CI `paths-ignore` set — so the required `test` check never runs, never reports, and
the PR sits `BLOCKED` forever. It is structurally unmergeable through the normal path, so it is
merged directly: `gh api --method PUT repos/ManifoldKit/<companion>/pulls/<N>/merge -f merge_method=squash`.
This carve-out applies **only** to companion release PRs, never to core and never to a feature
PR; core release PRs still go through the merge queue (above). The rule was previously recorded
only in a comment inside manifold-llama's `ci.yml`, which is not where anyone looks for it.

Consequence for how velocity is read: **count core PRs merged, not companion tags.** A single
core change legitimately produces up to three tags (core + two companions); the companion
`deps:` republishes are coordination artifacts, not independent increments, and carry zero
bug-fix credit. This is a labeling/accounting fix, not a decoupling — the pins stay
`.upToNextMinor` because pre-1.0 core minors still break the backend-facing surface (the
canonical example: the `ClaimRegistry` instance-scoping change forced real companion source
edits, not just a version string). Widening the pins so companions republish *only* when
their own code changes is a **1.0 agenda item**, gated on freezing that surface — not
something to attempt while it still churns. Owned here; companion `AGENTS.md` files point back
to this section.

## PR workflow

All changes go through PRs — direct pushes to `main` are blocked.

1. Branch off `main`, commit with conventional commits
2. `gh pr create --title "feat: ..." --body "..."`
3. Report the PR URL
4. Merge through the **merge queue**: `gh pr merge <N> --squash --auto` (queues the PR once required checks pass; the queue batches up to 5 PRs per validation run against the true merged tree). Never `--admin` and never `gh api`-direct merges — bypassing the queue skips pre-merge validation of the merged state AND forfeits ci.yml's `already-validated` post-merge skip, so main pays a redundant full CI run.

CI must pass all suites before merge. `ManifoldBackendsTests` covers the cloud/Foundation/mock surface — the MLX/Llama backend suites run in the companion repos' CI.

### Draft-PR review loop (mandatory for non-trivial PRs)

Every **non-trivial** PR goes through an adversarial review-and-fix loop **on a draft PR, before CI runs**. CI is gated to skip draft PRs (`ci.yml`/`readme-snippets.yml`/`cold-start-human.yml`/`build-modes.yml` guard the run on `draft == false`, with `ready_for_review` in the trigger types), so the draft is a **zero-CI staging area** and marking ready is the single, deliberate CI trigger. This keeps green-but-wrong code — and its re-run latency tax — off CI. Run the loop by hand (some harnesses automate it — e.g. Claude Code's `/ship` skill; see CLAUDE.md):

1. **Implement** in an isolated worktree off `origin/main` (never the current branch). Open a **draft** PR the moment it compiles (protect work early).
2. **Review** — dispatch an independent, skeptical reviewer against the diff: correctness, the premise/assumptions, scope discipline, conventions, and *is the feature actually live or inert* (the #2064 lesson — a read path with no writer is dead code).
3. **Fix** — apply findings, push to the same branch (still draft).
4. **Local gate — the FULL affected test targets, not `--filter <featureSuite>`.** Cross-cutting audits (`TestSuiteSilentSkipAuditTest`, `SilentCatchAuditTest`, schema/codegen/snapshot guards) live *outside* feature suites, so a filtered run goes green while CI goes red (exactly how #2064's `try? XCTUnwrap` reached CI). Run the affected target(s) whole, plus the audit suites by name. For added test files, `grep -rnE 'try\? (XCTUnwrap|XCTSkip)' Tests/` must come back clean.
5. **Mark ready** (`gh pr ready`) **only when review-clean and the local gate is green** — that flip is what triggers CI.

**Guards ship with a demonstrated red.** A PR that adds or edits a **CI
gate** — a workflow job, required
check, canary, scheduled guard, or lint — includes in its body (a) a link to a
red run or checked-in fixture proving the gate fires on the defect it exists to
catch, and (b) confirmation the check actually **blocks** (required-check or
merge-queue-enforced): red-but-not-blocking is how the api-digester reds were
sailed past (#2274, #2287), and "first run green" proves nothing for fail-open
machinery — a green run is indistinguishable from an inert one. In-suite audits
satisfy this structurally via Principle 4's in-file `test_sabotage_*` +
`AuditSabotageCoverageAuditTest`; shell tooling via `ScriptFailOpenAuditTest`;
workflow-level gates have no in-`swift test` tripwire, so the reviewer asks for
the evidence — a named review question alongside step 2's "is this actually
live?".

**Non-trivial** = touches **2+ files** OR adds/changes **behavior or logic**. Trivial single-file mechanical edits (typo, version bump, comment/doc-only, pure rename) skip the loop and go straight to a normal PR. Edits to CI workflows, `release-please-config.json`, or `Package.swift` are **never trivial**, whatever the line count — automation inputs have compounding blast radius. When in doubt, run the loop.

## Issue & PR hygiene

CI is macOS-only and the repo is public, so runner minutes are free — the budget is **latency**: GitHub caps concurrent macOS jobs org-wide (~5), one `ci.yml` run fans out up to 5 of them, and each run pays an ~8-min cold `swift build` floor (own-module build artifacts are deliberately not cached — restored objects go stale; tried and reverted twice. Dependency checkouts/artifacts *are* cached). The dominant lever is run count, not per-run speed.

- **Kill the re-run tax.** Run the full `scripts/test.sh --profile local` gate before *every* push — CI is the last check, not the iteration loop. A red run wastes a cold compile and holds concurrency slots every other queued job waits behind.
- **Merge through the queue** (`gh pr merge <N> --squash --auto`); never `--admin`, never `gh api`-direct. The queue validates the true merged tree pre-merge and lets the push-to-main CI run self-skip; bypassing it forfeits both.
- **Batch toward an interior optimum.** Prefer fewer, larger units of work, **but split when a diff exceeds ~40 changed files or ~800 net non-generated lines** — past that, review quality and conflict/revert risk dominate the saved CI run. Superseded in-flight runs auto-cancel and unchanged-path jobs auto-skip, so over-batching is not free either. Single-file PRs are a smell — batch them.
- **No phased feature splits.** Ship a feature as one PR, not P0→P5. If it's too big to review at once, stack it behind a draft and merge the stack as one — do not open a CI-triggering PR per phase.
- **One feature = one PR across all backends.** Don't fan out per-backend; use a backend checklist in the PR body.
- **Tests and docs ship in the feature PR**, not as follow-ups.
- **Don't open issues for follow-ups, phases, or "while I'm here" cleanups.** The tracker is for real bugs and feature asks with external visibility. For multi-PR work use one tracking issue with a checklist — existing umbrellas: #753 (tool calling), #754 (demo-picker test matrix), #755 (fuzz harness v2).
- **CI-cost levers already pulled (June 2026 — verify before re-investigating):** the doc-snippet gate compiles all snippets in one SwiftPM build (#1870, ~17 min → ~2.5 min); the doc gates run on `pull_request` only, with the nightly `doc-gates` job as the post-merge backstop; `docs.yml` deliberately keeps `cancel-in-progress: false` so a publish is never killed mid-deploy. **CI runners ship Bash 3.2** (no `declare -A`) — test shell-script edits under `/bin/bash`.
