/// fires **synchronously on the GCD dispatch queue** before the MainActor hop. This
/// lets `LlamaBackend` call `stopGeneration()` — an atomic, thread-safe operation —
/// immediately when pressure is detected, rather than waiting for the next run-loop
/// cycle. The callback fires from an arbitrary thread; callers must not perform
/// blocking work inside it.
