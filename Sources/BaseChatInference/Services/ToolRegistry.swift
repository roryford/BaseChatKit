// MARK: - ToolRegistry

/// Main-actor store of ``ToolExecutor`` instances keyed by case-insensitive
/// tool name.
///
/// The registry is the single dispatch seam between the generation loop and
/// user-registered tools. It handles:
///
/// - case-insensitive name lookup (with a warning when the model casing
///   differs from registration)
/// - JSON parsing of the raw ``ToolCall/arguments`` string into
///   ``JSONSchemaValue``
/// - optional schema validation (wave 2 wires an injected
///   ``JSONSchemaValidating`` implementation)
/// - stamping ``ToolResult/callId`` from the incoming call
/// - classifying lookup / parse / throw failures into
///   ``ToolResult/ErrorKind`` values
///
/// ## Isolation
///
/// ``ToolRegistry`` is deliberately `@MainActor final class`, not an `actor`.
/// The coordinator that drives it is MainActor-isolated; making the registry
/// an actor would force a hop on every dispatch for no benefit. The executor's
/// async `execute` call may still suspend off the main actor inside its own
/// implementation.
///
/// ## Reentrancy
///
/// MainActor isolation serialises *entry* into ``register(_:)``,
/// ``unregister(name:)``, and ``dispatch(_:)``, but `await
/// executor.execute(arguments:)` inside ``dispatch(_:)`` suspends the
/// current task. While that suspension is in flight, another MainActor
/// caller can enter the registry and mutate the tool table — register
/// a replacement, unregister the in-flight tool, swap the validator, or
/// adjust the ``outputPolicy``.
///
/// The dispatch contract is:
///
/// > ``ToolRegistry`` captures the executor at dispatch entry. Registry
/// > mutations during a suspended dispatch do not affect that dispatch's
/// > outcome — the originally-resolved executor runs to completion.
/// > Subsequent dispatches see the mutated state.
///
/// Concretely:
///
/// - The executor is looked up exactly once, at the top of ``dispatch(_:)``.
///   The local `executor` reference holds the value; later table mutations
///   on the same name do not retarget it.
/// - The ``outputPolicy`` and ``validator`` references are also captured
///   into local constants at dispatch entry, so a mid-flight policy swap
///   only affects subsequent dispatches.
/// - Snapshots taken from ``definitions`` reflect whatever state the
///   table is in when the snapshot is read. Mid-dispatch mutations are
///   visible immediately — the registry doesn't hide the change, it
///   merely refuses to retarget the in-flight call.
///
/// As an observability hook, ``unregister(name:)`` emits a warning when
/// it drops a tool that has at least one dispatch in flight. The
/// in-flight dispatch still completes against the originally-resolved
/// executor; the warning exists so ad-hoc registry juggling is visible
/// in the inference log.
