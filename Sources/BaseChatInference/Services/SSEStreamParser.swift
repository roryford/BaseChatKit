/// Configurable caps applied to SSE (and NDJSON) parsing to defend against
/// hostile or misconfigured upstream servers.
///
/// The parser enforces three separate bounds:
///
/// - ``maxEventBytes`` caps the size of a single event payload buffer. A
///   malicious server cannot make the client swallow a 100 MB `data:` line.
/// - ``maxTotalBytes`` caps cumulative bytes across the whole stream. This
///   stops a server that drips just-small-enough events forever.
/// - ``maxEventsPerSecond`` caps the yield rate. A flood of 1-byte events is
///   rejected before it can starve the consumer.
///
/// Defaults (``default``) are intentionally well above any realistic provider
/// throughput — OpenAI, Anthropic, and Ollama all emit events far smaller
/// than 1 MB and well under 5,000 events per second — so legitimate traffic is
/// never throttled.
///
/// ## Tuning
///
/// Most apps never need to change these. Raise a cap only if you observe
/// legitimate traffic failing — for example, a provider that ships a
/// multi-megabyte tool-use result in a single event. Lower a cap when you
/// point a backend at an untrusted endpoint and want to narrow the attack
/// surface further.
///
/// ```swift
/// // App-wide: applies to every SSECloudBackend at launch.
/// BaseChatConfiguration.shared.sseStreamLimits = SSEStreamLimits(
///     maxEventBytes: 500_000,
///     maxTotalBytes: 10_000_000,
///     maxEventsPerSecond: 2_000
