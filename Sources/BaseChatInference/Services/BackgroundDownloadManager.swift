    /// Removes temp-download files left behind by a previous process that crashed
    /// or was force-killed between receiving the download and moving it into the
    /// models directory.
    ///
    /// ### What the sweep deletes
    /// A file in `FileManager.default.temporaryDirectory` is removed iff **all** of:
    /// 1. Filename starts with ``tempFilePrefix`` (`"basechatkit-dl-"`).
    /// 2. Extension equals ``tempFileExtension`` (`"download"`).
    /// 3. It is a regular file (not a directory, symlink, or special file).
    /// 4. Its modification date is older than ``staleTempFileAge`` (24 hours).
    ///
    /// ### What the sweep preserves
    /// Any file missing even one of the four properties above. Notably:
    /// - Temp files written by other subsystems (wrong prefix or extension).
    /// - Files currently being processed by the delegate in this process
    ///   (tracked in ``activeTempPaths`` — registered/unregistered around
    ///   the temp→final move in `didFinishDownloadingTo`).
    /// - Files newer than 24 hours — secondary guard for files handed off from
    ///   the system's background transfer service before the delegate registers them.
    /// - Files whose attributes cannot be read (logged and skipped).
    ///
    /// Runs on launch from ``reconnectBackgroundSession()``.
