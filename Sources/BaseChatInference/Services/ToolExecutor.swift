// MARK: - ToolExecutor

/// A runtime-executable tool definition.
///
/// Conformers pair a ``ToolDefinition`` (the JSON-Schema contract the model
/// sees) with an `execute(arguments:)` hook that runs the tool and returns a
/// ``ToolResult``. Executors are stored in a ``ToolRegistry`` and dispatched
/// by the orchestration loop when the model emits a ``ToolCall``.
///
/// ## Arguments type
///
/// The protocol intentionally takes ``JSONSchemaValue`` — not a raw `String`
/// — so adapter layers (MCP bridges, AppIntents, macro-generated tools) can
/// hand a structured, already-parsed argument tree to the executor without
/// re-serialising through a string. ``ToolRegistry/dispatch(_:)`` handles the
/// `String`→`JSONSchemaValue` parse at the registry boundary.
///
/// ## Typed adapter
///
/// Most callers do not implement this protocol directly. Use
/// ``TypedToolExecutor`` to wrap a strongly-typed Swift handler — the adapter
/// handles JSON encode/decode on both sides so the handler signature stays
/// free of `JSONSchemaValue`.
///
/// ## Atomicity
///
/// `execute(arguments:)` is **atomic** from the orchestrator's point of view:
/// the registry observes exactly one outcome per call — either a fully-formed
/// ``ToolResult`` returned from the function, or a thrown error. There is no
/// partial-emission channel. Executors that perform streaming or multi-step
/// work (streaming file reads, subprocess pipes, streamed HTTP responses,
/// multi-RPC transactions) MUST buffer that work internally and only return a
/// single complete ``ToolResult`` once the work has succeeded.
///
/// When an executor throws mid-work, ``ToolRegistry/dispatch(_:)`` records a
/// ``ToolResult`` with ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/permanent`` and
/// `String(describing: error)` as the content. Any in-flight state the
/// executor had accumulated — bytes read, chunks processed, rows fetched — is
/// discarded and never flows into the transcript. The model sees the error
/// description, not the partial output.
///
/// The throw path is classified as ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/permanent``
/// (not ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/transient``) by design: an uncategorised
/// thrown `Error` is the "I don't know what went wrong" escape hatch, and
/// labelling it retry-safe would push agents into loops on permanent
/// failures (logic bugs, schema mismatches, auth denials) that no amount of
/// retrying will fix. Executors that *know* a failure is retriable must
/// return an explicit ``ToolResult/init(callId:content:errorKind:)`` with
/// ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/transient`` instead of throwing — same rule for
/// ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/timeout``, ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/rateLimited``,
/// ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/cancelled``, and the other specific kinds.
/// Throwing is the last-resort catch-all, not a retry signal.
///
/// Practical consequences:
///
/// - If your tool streams and you want to preserve what you got before
///   failing, aggregate into a local buffer and only throw after you have
///   decided to abandon that buffer. If the partial result is useful, return
///   a successful ``ToolResult`` whose ``ToolResult/content`` contains the
///   buffered prefix plus a description of why collection stopped, rather
///   than throwing.
/// - If the failure is transient (disk I/O hiccup, dropped connection,
///   rate-limit response), return
///   `ToolResult(callId: "", content: "...", errorKind: .transient)` rather
///   than throwing — this tells the orchestrator the call is safe to retry.
/// - Do not rely on side-effects (written files, DB rows, API calls) to
///   communicate partial progress to later turns — the orchestrator only
///   sees the returned ``ToolResult``.
/// - A future extension may add an explicit partial-content channel; until
///   then, this atomic request/response shape is the contract.

    /// of `false` so they auto-approve regardless of the host's policy. The

// MARK: - TypedToolExecutor

/// Generic adapter that exposes a strongly-typed Swift handler as a
/// ``ToolExecutor``.
///
/// The adapter owns three responsibilities:
/// 1. Decode the incoming ``JSONSchemaValue`` into `Arguments` via `JSONDecoder`.
/// 2. Call the handler.
/// 3. Encode the handler's `Result` as a JSON string and wrap it in a ``ToolResult``.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct WeatherArgs: Decodable, Sendable { let city: String }
/// struct WeatherResult: Encodable, Sendable { let summary: String; let celsius: Double }
///
/// let weather = TypedToolExecutor<WeatherArgs, WeatherResult>(
///     definition: ToolDefinition(name: "get_weather", description: "Returns weather.", parameters: schema)
/// ) { args in
///     WeatherResult(summary: "Sunny", celsius: 22.0)
/// }
/// registry.register(weather)
/// ```
///
/// Decode or encode failures throw — ``ToolRegistry/dispatch(_:)`` catches them
/// and returns a ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/permanent`` result. Malformed JSON in
/// the raw ``ToolCall/arguments`` string is classified as
/// ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/invalidArguments`` at the registry boundary before
/// this adapter sees it.
///
/// ## Atomicity
///
/// The adapter is inherently atomic: the handler's `Result` is JSON-encoded
/// exactly once **after** the handler returns normally. If the handler throws,
/// nothing is encoded and no ``ToolResult`` is produced — the error bubbles to
/// ``ToolRegistry/dispatch(_:)`` which records a
/// ``ToolResult/ErrorKind/permanent`` result with the error description and
/// discards any work the handler had performed. See the ``ToolExecutor``
/// protocol's Atomicity section for the full contract; handlers that perform
/// streaming or multi-step work should buffer internally before returning.
