/// `InboundPayload` is the single shape the chat view model drains on
/// ingest, regardless of which entry point produced it. This keeps
/// launch-time wiring symmetric: every inbound source serialises itself
/// into a payload, the app writes it into a pending buffer, and the view
/// model ingests it once persistence is ready.
///
/// ## Forward compatibility
///
/// ``attachments`` carries ``MessagePart`` values so richer inputs
/// (images, files) can ride alongside the prompt without changing the
/// API shape. Today only App Intent and deep-link flows populate this
/// struct; Share Extension support (tracked by #440) and Action Extension
/// support (#441) will reuse the same type when they land.
///
/// The struct is intentionally storage-agnostic. Callers persist it
/// through whatever transport suits the caller — App Group
/// `UserDefaults`, pasteboard JSON, or a file in a shared container —
/// and hand the decoded value to the view model.
