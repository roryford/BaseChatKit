/// Composition helper that unifies the `Task` + cancellation + state-lock
/// dance every test mock backend used to hand-roll.
///
/// Three test mock backends (`ChaosBackend`, `PerceivedLatencyBackend`,
/// `SlowMockBackend`) all need the same lifecycle plumbing around their
/// `generate()` implementation:
///
/// - kick off an `AsyncThrowingStream` whose continuation is fed by a `Task`
/// - wire `continuation.onTermination` so a dropped consumer cancels the task
/// - record the task so an external `cancelGeneration()` can stop it
/// - clear the slot when the task finishes naturally
/// - flip the per-backend `_isGenerating` flag back to `false` once the body
///   returns, regardless of whether it threw, finished, or was cancelled
///
/// The body closure is responsible for the actual token production. The
/// `onFinish` closure is the per-backend "I'm done generating" signal. The
/// helper does not hold any lock while invoking it — each conformer is
/// responsible for acquiring its own `NSLock` (or other state-lock
/// discipline) inside the closure if it needs one.
///
/// ## Termination ordering
///
/// `body()` runs to completion → `onFinish()` fires → `continuation.finish()`
/// is called → the slot is cleared (only if it still holds *this* task).
/// `onFinish` runs *before* `continuation.finish()` so that consumers
/// iterating `events` see the `isGenerating == false` state before their
/// `for try await` loop exits — matching the original
/// `defer { finishGeneration() }` ordering. The identity-aware clear means
/// a re-entrant `makeStream` call from inside `onFinish` (which sets a new
/// task in the slot) is not clobbered by the original task's cleanup.
///
/// ## Why a class, not a `@MainActor` protocol
///
/// The conformer classes are `final class @unchecked Sendable` with
/// non-`@MainActor` `deinit`s. A `@MainActor protocol ... { var generationTask:
/// Task<Void, Never>? { get set } }` would (a) be unsatisfiable by stored
/// properties on non-`@MainActor` classes under Swift 6 strict concurrency,
/// (b) make the existing `deinit` cancellation illegal, and (c) collide with
/// the existing `NSLock` discipline. Composition keeps each backend's
/// concurrency story intact.
