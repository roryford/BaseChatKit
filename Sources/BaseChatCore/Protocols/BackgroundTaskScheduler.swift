///     <string>com.basechatkit.background.post-generation</string>

/// Schedules background work that survives the app being suspended on iOS.

/// it bridges to `BGTaskScheduler`; on macOS, where there is no equivalent
/// foreground/background life-cycle, it runs the closure inline on a detached
/// task. Both paths enforce the configured ``MemoryBudget`` — work whose
/// process footprint breaches the ceiling has its `Task` cancelled, and the
/// closure observes the cancellation through the standard `Task.isCancelled`
/// / `try Task.checkCancellation()` channel. The host can re-schedule from
/// there.
///
/// `identifier` is a free-form string. On iOS it must match an entry in
/// `BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers` (see ``BaseChatBackgroundTaskIdentifiers``);
/// on macOS it is used purely as a cancellation key.

    ///   - identifier: Stable identifier for this work. Must be registered in
