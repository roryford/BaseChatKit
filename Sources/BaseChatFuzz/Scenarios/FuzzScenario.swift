/// Scenarios differ from ``Detector`` in direction of travel:
///
/// - A ``Detector`` inspects a recorded ``RunRecord`` **post-hoc** and flags a
///   bug shape across many runs.
/// - A `FuzzScenario` **drives** a backend with a specific input pattern (budget
///   setting, cancellation timing, retry storm, …) and asserts an invariant on
///   the resulting event stream.
///
/// Scenarios live next to detectors so the harness can enumerate them via
/// ``ScenarioRegistry`` the same way it enumerates detectors, and so the
/// XCTest harness can execute each scenario's invariant as a focused test.
///
/// Scenarios are deliberately **not** part of `FuzzRunner.runSingle`'s loop —
/// they are a separate axis of coverage that exercises control-flow shapes
/// (cancel, retry, disable-thinking) a random corpus can't reach reliably.
