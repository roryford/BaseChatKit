/// `FuzzBackendFactory` that round-robins through a fixed list of child factories,
/// advancing one step each time `makeHandle()` is called. Used by the CLI to
/// rotate the Ollama target model per iteration when the caller did not pin a
/// specific model with `--model <substr>`.
///
/// ## Why option (b)?
///
/// The #501 brief sketched two designs: an array-of-factories on `FuzzRunner`
/// or a single wrapping factory. The wrapping factory keeps the runner's
/// `init(config:factory:)` contract from #537 intact and isolates rotation
/// behind the existing factory boundary — the runner is unchanged.
///
/// ## Determinism
///
/// Rotation is a plain monotonic index increment, so replay against a pinned
/// seed is stable as long as the caller provides the same ordered list of
/// child factories. The CLI sorts discovered Ollama models by UTF-8 byte
/// order before handing them here, so two invocations on the same machine
/// yield the same sequence regardless of the order Ollama reports them.
///
/// ## Thread safety
///
/// `FuzzBackendFactory` is `Sendable`. The runner is an actor and calls
/// `makeHandle()` serially today, but rotation state is guarded by a
/// `ManagedCriticalState` so a future concurrent caller can't corrupt the
/// index. The struct itself stays a value type; the lock sits behind a
/// reference so `Sendable` conformance holds.
