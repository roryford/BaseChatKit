    /// plus any attachments as a single user message, and starts generation
    /// via the same `sendMessage()` path used by the compose bar. The
    /// ``InboundPayload/source`` is logged for attribution so production
    /// traces can separate intent-driven turns from user-typed ones.
    ///
    /// ## Requirements
    ///
    /// - ``configure(persistence:)`` must have been called. Otherwise this
    ///   method no-ops after logging a warning — callers should buffer the
    ///   payload until persistence is ready.
    /// - A model or endpoint must be loaded; if not, the usual
    ///   "no model loaded" error surfaces via ``activeError`` and generation
    ///   is not started, matching the compose-bar contract.
    ///
    /// ## Concurrency
    ///
    /// Back-to-back ingests serialize on the main actor: each call creates
    /// its own session before kicking off generation, so concurrent calls
    /// produce distinct sessions rather than interleaving messages.
    ///
    /// - Parameter payload: The inbound payload to ingest.
