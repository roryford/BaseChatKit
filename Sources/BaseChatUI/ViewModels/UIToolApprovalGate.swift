/// A ``ToolApprovalGate`` backed by a MainActor-isolated pending-approval queue
/// that UI surfaces can observe and resolve.
///
/// The gate cooperates with ``ChatViewModel`` and the backing
/// ``GenerationCoordinator``: when the model emits a ``ToolCall``, the
/// coordinator awaits ``approve(_:)``. Depending on ``policy`` this either:
/// - returns immediately (``Policy/autoApprove`` or the cached "already
///   approved once" flag for ``Policy/askOncePerSession``), or
/// - appends the call to ``pending`` and suspends until the view calls
///   ``resolve(callId:with:)`` from the approval sheet's Approve/Deny buttons.
///
/// Because the gate is an `@Observable` class, SwiftUI views observing
/// ``pending`` automatically re-render when a new call arrives or the queue
/// drains.
///
/// ## Session boundary
///
/// The queue and the once-per-session latch are both cleared by
/// ``resetForNewSession()``. ``ChatViewModel/switchToSession(_:)`` invokes
/// this so an approval granted in one session doesn't silently carry over
/// into another. Hosts that drive the gate directly (tests, non-UI apps)
/// should call the same method when they swap sessions.
