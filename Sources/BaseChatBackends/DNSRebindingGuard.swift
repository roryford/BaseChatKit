/// Request-layer mitigation for DNS rebinding attacks on remote endpoints.
///
/// `APIEndpoint.validate()` intentionally skips DNS resolution (it is called
/// synchronously from SwiftUI forms and must stay fast). This guard fills that
/// gap by resolving the hostname immediately before each outbound connection and
/// rejecting any address in a private, link-local, or reserved range.
///
/// ## Threat model
/// An attacker registers `evil.example.com` and configures it as a custom
/// endpoint. Initially the domain resolves to a public IP that passes structural
/// validation. After the user has saved the endpoint, the attacker points the DNS
/// record at `169.254.169.254` (cloud IMDS) or `192.168.x.x` (LAN). On the next
/// API call, without this guard, the request would silently reach the internal
/// host. With this guard the connection is rejected before any bytes are sent.
///
/// ## Scope
/// Applied to every outbound connection made by:
/// - ``SSECloudBackend/generate(prompt:systemPrompt:config:)`` (OpenAI, Claude,
///   Ollama, and custom backends)
/// - ``OllamaModelListService/fetchModels(from:)`` (model-list fetches)
/// - ``OllamaBackend/loadModel(from:plan:)`` (pre-flight thinking-capability probe)
///
/// Localhost URLs (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `::1`) always bypass the guard —
/// these are explicitly configured local servers, not DNS-resolved targets.
