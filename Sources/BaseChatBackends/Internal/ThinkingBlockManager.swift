/// Tracks whether a streaming parser is currently inside a thinking block and

/// Three SSE backends (`OpenAIBackend`, `ClaudeBackend`,
/// `OpenAIResponsesBackend`) all need the same primitive: "remember that we
/// yielded a `.thinkingToken`; the next non-thinking event — visible token,
/// upstream `reasoning_done`, stream end, or thrown error — must yield
/// `.thinkingComplete` exactly once before whatever comes next."
///
/// The state machine is intentionally minimal. Parsers keep their inline

/// `.thinkingComplete` emission so the close-rule is identical across
/// backends and survives refactors of the surrounding parsing code.

/// continuation.yield(.thinkingToken(delta))
/// thinking.open()
/// // ... saw a visible-content delta ...

/// continuation.yield(.token(delta))
/// // ... stream ended or threw ...
/// thinking.flushIfOpen(into: continuation)
